<h4>Feb 22, 2017</h4>

<p>Rumors are flowing in constantly, I guess in this day and age of social media, word gets around fast.  Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of some of the different rumors around the league, most of them centered around Boston.
p.medium Boston has a number of good players with affordable contracts in addition to a bevy of potential lottery draft picks.  The class of 2017, many say, will be one of the better drafts of the last few years so the draft picks have even higher value.  As the second ranked team in the East, the Celtics are looking for a two-way player, a superstar that can buoy Isaiah Thomas and Al Horford and allow them to seriously challenge the Cavaliers for the Eastern Conference Championship, these players are quite rare and Danny Ainge probably doesn&rsquo;t want to disrupt his core players to make this happen so most likely this superstar will come from a team in rebuild mode or on the cusp of being a first round exit from the playoffs that wants high/lottery draft picks.  Jimmy Butler, Blake Griffin, Paul George, and Andre Drummond fit this mold, I&rsquo;d throw in Carmelo Anthony as an honorable mention, but he&rsquo;s definitely not quite the same caliber defensively as the others.</p>

<span class="blake-griffin"></span>
<span class="paul-george"></span>
<span class="andre-drummond"></span>
<span class="carmelo-anthony"></span></p>

<p>The Celtics are in a great position because there&rsquo;s no guarantee that adding any of these players will help push them into the NBA Finals moreover win against the Golden State Warriors, so technically the deal would have to be so sweet that Ainge would kick himself if he didn&rsquo;t take it.  The status quo is not bad and the summertime will be another chance to retool.</p>

<p>A second option would be to bolster the defense, this is more of an incremental change, the Celtics lack a serious rebounder and defensive threat in the post, Nikola Vucevic and Andrew Bogut fit this mold.</p>

<p><span class="nikola-vucevic"></span>
<span class="andrew-bogut"></span></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping Paul George gets a second chance to redeem himself on a Championship caliber team.</p>
