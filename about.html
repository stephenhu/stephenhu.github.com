      first and foremost, i consider myself a maker, carving things out of the
      ether into meaningful and usable experiences, i enjoy refining things over
      time so that they become functionally simple, easy to comprehend, yet
      powerful.  as a maker i enjoy fast things whether it be fast cars or
      scalable solutions.  and my style has always been that of generalist, able
      to understand different aspects of a problem from a depth and breadth
      perspective, i'm a full stack engineer by trade.

      our daily lives involve so many objects and interactions with these objects
      that the role of maker becomes that of champion for the quality of life
      and evolution of mankind.
