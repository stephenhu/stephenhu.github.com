      <h3>China 4G</h3>
      <date>Sat Feb  1 09:28:21 2014</date>
      <p><img src="http://www.hk.chinamobile.com/export/system/modules/com.cmhk.page.template.common/resources/en/images/logo.png" alt="China Mobile"></p>
      
      <p>china mobile is the world&#39;s largest mobile carrier with over 700m users.  when
      i moved to china in 2007, there were two other carriers, China Unicom and China
      Telecom, service was limited to 2g (GSM/CDMA/EDGE), but neither was even worthy
      of consideration, both carriers&#39; service and phone selection were really
      sub-standard at the time so pretty much everyone used china mobile.  then came
      3g service, china unicom was first to market in china and they leveraged the
      3g standard that was most prevalent in europe, wcdma.  china telecom went with
      cdma2000 (us standard) and china mobile was forced by the government to
      develop and research the homegrown td-cdma standard.  the chinese telecom
      industry is riddled with a lot of history, but the short summary is that the
      telecom industry used to be fully owned by the government and known as china
      telecom, sometime later china mobile and china unicom were spun off and all
      three companies were privatized.  large portions of all three companies are
      still owned and regulated by the government, but they act as separate
      companies for the most part.</p>
      
      <p>china unicom took early adopters advantage by pushing out their 3g service
      coupled with a great partnership with apple, iphones were subsidized heavily
      (often times free with a long term contract), and china unicom was the only
      player in town that had 3g service for the iphone in the beginning.  later
      on china telecom and china mobile came out with iphone support, but china
      mobile leveraged the super slow and problematic td-cdma technology.</p>
      
      <p>today, a majority of chinese users still leverage 2g services for simple
      phone and text messaging, yet there&#39;s a growing consumer base that requires
      higher bandwidth for all the new mobile apps.</p>
      
      <p>some say that china mobile&#39;s market share was hit hard by the advent of china
      unicom&#39;s iphone and 3g combination, however, i think china unicom and telecom
      spent significant amounts of money for 3g infrastructure, which at the time
      (2012) was already starting to phase out.  in my opinion, china mobile
      purposely invested big on getting 4g out the door before their competitors,
      and curbed spending on 3g.  and on jan 17, 2014 china mobile launched 4g
      services which beat unicom and telecom by many months.</p>
      
      <p>4g is promising technology, and china mobile&#39;s td-lte offering, again
      homegrown technology, has been touted as quite comparable to foreign offerings.
      i&#39;ve actually been fortunate enough to test this in hangzhou while on a cab,
      basically i can watch movies in high definition without any lag.  i&#39;ve been
      a long time china unicom user (since the iphone 4 came out in 2012), and the
      3g service has been just good enough to run some of my apps, however, watching
      movies has been completely inconceivable.  i also find that china unicom&#39;s
      network coverage is really spotty, often times the signal being really weak
      (0-1 bar even in the most populated big cities like beijing and shanghai).</p>
      
      <p>i plopped down for china mobile&#39;s 4g service just to test the waters since i
      had reasonably good experiences with china mobile&#39;s 2g offering and purchased a mifi
      router.  apple (or china mobile) finally conceded and decided to work together
      to offer the iphone 5s/5c on china mobile&#39;s 4g network, however, currently
      you can only find 16 gb models, my pictures already exceed 16 gb!  so i&#39;m
      going to wait until the 64 gb model comes out and the network coverage
      slowly increases.  to this day, i still think china unicom&#39;s coverage is poor,
      but china mobile should have much more funding to invest in proliferation of
      its physical network.  in consolation, if there&#39;s signal, the speed of 4g
      in china is so far so good, movies don&#39;t lag at all.  i&#39;ve also heard that
      china unicom and telecom will lease some of the 4g network from china mobile
      while trying to get approval to use foreign 4g network technologies.</p>
