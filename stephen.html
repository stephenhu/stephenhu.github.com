      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <date>Fri Jan 24 07:05:35 2014</date>
      <p>welcome, this is my very first blog post here!  i&#39;ve been blogging
      for a fairly long time, my very first blog was written in pure html
      back in my college days (circa &#39;96).  i still remember my first text
      editor, it was this gui called crisp that ran on windows, syntax
      highlighting and all!  later on, after graduating, i dabbled a little
      in php and wrote my own blogging app with mysql backend, this was
      all hosted from godaddy, i would upload new files using ftp to a
      linux server running apache in one of godaddy&#39;s datacenters, this
      server was probably hosting several hundred other sites as well.</p>
      
      <p>i had stopped blogging for some time around 2008 or so, part of the
      reasoning was probably because my domain expired, but also because
      micro-blogging tools like facebook and twitter had pretty much taken
      over as communication tools because they were quick and simple (granted
      these tools were blocked in china which is why i never really used these).
      however, sometimes, writing a lengthy post about some particular topic
      without the constraints or associations that come along with
      micro-blogging tools is actually quite refreshing.  tools like tumblr
      and posterous have made blogging easier, and static site generators
      like jekyll have brought back blogging in a new and interesting way.</p>
      
      <p>anyway, it&#39;s great to be back, and i&#39;m actually quite excited to be
      blogging again, and on top of that, i&#39;ve been working on a tool to
      help aide in the process called <a href="https://github.com/stephenhu/meta">meta</a>.</p>
