<h4>Feb 6, 2014</h4>

<p><img src="http://cdn.us.playstation.com/pscomauth/groups/public/documents/webasset/ps4-hrdware-large1.jpg" alt="Playstation 4" /></p>

<p>playstation 4 launched in mid-november of last year (2013), this is almost 20 years
after the initial launch of the product and 8 years after the launch of its
predecessor, the playstation 3, and 14 years after the venerable playstation 2.
supplies are limited across the world, however, the us version is starting to
become more widely available, but in essence, there&rsquo;s no greater time like now
for sony to pick up the pace in an all new gaming world.</p>

<p>i can&rsquo;t be 100% certain, but if i recall correctly, sony invented the marketing
tactic to increase pent up demand by releasing limited quantities of product.
this seems to be employed by apple and other companies these days, granted there&rsquo;s
a real lag in being able to mass produce sophisticated products such as electronics,
but i would imagine most companies of the time would wait until the manafacturing
caught up before starting the marketing campaign.  playstation 2 came out in
mid-november of 2000 and this was the first gaming console with dvd support
which would boost the storage capacity for games meaning better graphics.  people
would line up overnight just to be on the waiting list to purchase a console,
this was also during the beginning of winter which meant frigid temperatures,
there were even a few instances of fights breaking out to get one of these
consoles, i believe.  overall this tactic is great for gaming companies because
this allows the software companies to invest the time in creating better games,
the ps4 doesn&rsquo;t have any spectacular games at the moment, all the great ones
will be coming a few months later.  this is similar to the playstation 2 launch
except that the playstation 2 is backwards compatible with playstation games,
and playstation 3 is compatible with all previous generation console games, the
playstation 4 is not compatible with any previous console games.  this is a bit
of a strange decision by sony to break all compatibility, but part of this was
because of the strange decision to use the cell processor in the playstation 3
which is a completely different computer architecture from the x86-64 instruction
set in the playstation 4, the only way to create backwards compatibility is to
use an emulator which would make performance a real issue.  anyway, without
any killer games, there&rsquo;s really no rush at the moment to purchase a playstation
4, all current games can be purchased for playstation 3 as well (at a lower
price).</p>

<p>in terms of compatibility the recently released microsoft console, xbox one,
also doesn&rsquo;t support games from the previous console, xbox 360, which is again,
a very odd decision.  unlike the playstation 3, the xbox 360 is also leveraging
the x86 instruction set architecture, so perhaps this is more of a marketing
decision to push game makers to make games on the latest console.  the hardware
specifications for the xbox one and playstation 4 are similar, both sport x86-64
processors from amd and radeon graphics processors.  what really will set the two
consoles apart will be the games.  however, i contend that the real challenge
will be from the mass entry of games from tablets and mobile phones which offers
a bit of a different gaming experience at a fraction of the cost.  some of the
games on iphone, for example, can compete in terms of graphics capabilities
and gameplay with those on a  console, however, the experience of having at
your fingertips, the ability to game anywhere almost anytime while being
connected will really challenge the legacies of playstation and xbox.  i also
see the company valve, the maker of the steam which can be installed on diy
commodity x86 hardware as a real game changer.  the diy community is very adept
at upgrading hardware to get more gaming power while the console makers are
pretty much stuck with current generation hardware.  valve doesn&rsquo;t have a very
good mobile story at the moment though which puts them at a major disadvantage.</p>

<p>apple and google&rsquo;s model really change the dynamics of the gaming industry,
the lower cost of games, often times free compared to 59.99 usd for console
games, and access from anywhere is really disrupting.  microsoft and sony still
believe there&rsquo;s a vibrant community of people that prefer the hardcore
experience of sitting in a living room, but is this market enough or just a
niche that will eventually bring the console makers to become obsolete?</p>
