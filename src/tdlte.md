china mobile is the world's largest mobile carrier with over 700m users.  when
i moved to china in 2007, there were two other carriers, China Unicom and China
Telecom, service was limited to 2g (GSM/CDMA/EDGE), but neither was even worthy
of consideration, both carriers' service and phone selection were really
sub-standard at the time so pretty much everyone used china mobile.  then came
3g service, china unicom was first to market in china and they leveraged the
3g standard that was most prevalent in europe, wcdma.  china telecom went with
cdma2000 (us standard) and china mobile was forced by the government to
develop and research the homegrown td-cdma standard.  the chinese telecom
industry is riddled with a lot of history, but the short summary is that the
telecom industry used to be fully owned by the government and known as china
telecom, sometime later china mobile and china unicom were spun off and all
three companies were privatized.  large portions of all three companies are
still owned and regulated by the government, but they act as separate
companies for the most part.

china unicom took early adopters advantage by pushing out their 3g service
coupled with a great partnership with apple, iphones were subsidized heavily
(often times free with a long term contract), and china unicom was the only
player in town that had 3g service for the iphone in the beginning.  later
on china telecom and china mobile came out with iphone support, but china
mobile leveraged the super slow and problematic td-cdma technology.

today, a majority of chinese users still leverage 2g services for simple
phone and text messaging, yet there's a growing consumer base that requires
higher bandwidth for all the new mobile apps.

some say that china mobile's market share was hit hard by the advent of china
unicom's iphone and 3g combination, however, i think china unicom and telecom
spent significant amounts of money for 3g infrastructure, which at the time
(2012) was already starting to phase out.  in my opinion, china mobile
purposely invested big on getting 4g out the door before their competitors,
and curbed spending on 3g.  and on jan 17, 2014 china mobile launched 4g
services which beat unicom and telecom by many months.

4g is promising technology, and china mobile's td-lte offering, again
homegrown technology, has been touted as quite comparable to foreign offerings.
i've actually been fortunate enough to test this in hangzhou while on a cab,
basically i can watch movies in high definition without any lag.  i've been
a long time china unicom user (since the iphone 4 came out in 2012), and the
3g service has been just good enough to run some of my apps, however, watching
movies has been completely inconceivable.  i also find that china unicom's
network coverage is really spotty, often times the signal being really weak
(0-1 bar even in the most populated big cities like beijing and shanghai).

i plopped down for china mobile's 4g service just to test the waters since i
had reasonably good experiences with china mobile's 2g offering and purchased a mifi
router.  apple (or china mobile) finally conceded and decided to work together
to offer the iphone 5s/5c on china mobile's 4g network, however, currently
you can only find 16 gb models, my pictures already exceed 16 gb!  so i'm
going to wait until the 64 gb model comes out and the network coverage
slowly increases.  to this day, i still think china unicom's coverage is poor,
but china mobile should have much more funding to invest in proliferation of
its physical network.  in consolation, if there's signal, the speed of 4g
in china is so far so good, movies don't lag at all.  i've also heard that
china unicom and telecom will lease some of the 4g network from china mobile
while trying to get approval to use foreign 4g network technologies.
