i've been using macbooks for a very long time, my current one from work is
a fully spec'd out macbook pro retina, 15" screen, 512 gb ssd, 16 gb ram,
i7 quad core running at 2.7 ghz, a very well built piece of machinery from
both inside and out, however, it's a work machine and there's incredibly
crufty software put on the thing.  i also owned the very first intel based macbook, the
black plastic one, and before that, i had purchased several (used) powerbooks based
on the powerpc processor.  before the macbook craze, one of my favorite
laptops was the one i received from my first job at hp, it was an hp business
laptop (can't remember the model), i opted for an extra battery instead of
the cd drive which gave me 2 batteries and, at the time, 3-4 hours of battery life which was
truly unheard of, this was a time when the pentium m processor
was king, basically an offshoot of the pentium 3 with more power savings.
(i digress, but the pentium 4 was a new architecture compared to the pentium
m, but there were energy efficiency issues with the 4 that made the m look
really good in comparison.)  in between i've owned several thinkpads, a netbook
or 2 and several tablets.

since my initial use of laptops back in 2000 to now, suffice to say, my
requirements have changed quite dramatically, and, not to mention, the
technology's also gotten much, much better.  from a work perspective, i am
a managing director, but i still keep very close to software development and
haven't stopped coding, ever (during non-work hours of course).  so for work, my primary
use cases are for things like email, office apps (powerpoint, word, excel), some
browser apps, virtualization (on a rare occassion to install some software
for various platforms), and some new-fangled apps like evernote, dropbox,
webex, skype, etc.  screen real estate comes secondary to mobility and ease
of carrying around from conference room to conference room.  battery life
plays a critical role, though i think i can get by on 4-5 hours now which
most laptops today can handle with ease especially since i'm not really doing
much with the cpu's like compiling stuff or rendering video.  back in the olden
days, i'd probably do everything on my laptop, work, play, etc.  now with things
like ipads, most of the playing has transitioned over and really the focus can
be 100% on work.  the only problem is that i live a double life, after work,
i code a bit.  and because mobile apps have become quite popular, i imagine
i'll get to that ios app i've always been wanting to make which means that i
need a mac os x based system.  but the coding that i do these days doesn't
require compiling, mostly interpreted languages like ruby and then things
like html/css/js.  i still like to develop in linux, terminal vi style, but
i also like having a friendly desktop environment like mac os x or windows
that just makes things easy.  and most of the development that i do these days
is for distributed web systems, the ability to deploy multiple linux servers
is a must, this means that i need a hardcore cpu and lots, and lots of memory.
video cards are not that critical anymore as i don't play high resolution
games, so long as it can dual output in high definition to an external display.

as time passes, i find that i'm more accepting of what i'll deem polyware,
multiple pieces of hardware, i used to want 1 machine to rule them all, but i'm finding
that that's a bit of a hard reality at the moment.  i like my ipad for watching
movies, playing games, surfing the web, i like my iphone for phone, email,
text, and social networking, i like my workstation for doing hardcore development and cramming lots
of spinning disks, and having laptops for work mobility.  i've decided that i need
separate laptops for work and home, there are lots of tools to help synchronize
things and it's analogous to having multiple (paper) notebooks to house different
notes from different classes.

so my ideal laptop is pretty much the macbook air 11" except that the maximum
memory configuration is 8 gb, i need at least 16 gb, 32 gb would be nice, but
i imagine that would impact the power requirements.  it'd be nice if they
could get rid of the frame around the screen and give retina quality output
on the local display.  i don't need touchscreen or any of the nonsensical things
that microsoft's putting forth, a card reader slot would be nice, and at least
2 usb slots would be icing on the cake.  i'll probably wait an iteration or 2
of the macbook air, for now i'll just stick with the oblong retina macbook pro.
