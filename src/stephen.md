welcome, this is my very first blog post here!  i've been blogging
for a fairly long time, my very first blog was written in pure html
back in my college days (circa '96).  i still remember my first text
editor, it was this gui called crisp that ran on windows, syntax
highlighting and all!  later on, after graduating, i dabbled a little
in php and wrote my own blogging app with mysql backend, this was
all hosted from godaddy, i would upload new files using ftp to a
linux server running apache in one of godaddy's datacenters, this
server was probably hosting several hundred other sites as well.

i had stopped blogging for some time around 2008 or so, part of the
reasoning was probably because my domain expired, but also because
micro-blogging tools like facebook and twitter had pretty much taken
over as communication tools because they were quick and simple (granted
these tools were blocked in china which is why i never really used these).
however, sometimes, writing a lengthy post about some particular topic
without the constraints or associations that come along with
micro-blogging tools is actually quite refreshing.  tools like tumblr
and posterous have made blogging easier, and static site generators
like jekyll have brought back blogging in a new and interesting way.

anyway, it's great to be back, and i'm actually quite excited to be
blogging again, and on top of that, i've been working on a tool to
help aide in the process called [meta](https://github.com/stephenhu/meta).
