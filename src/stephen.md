this is my very first blog post for this new site, welcome!  the
facebook and twitter era cast a dark shadow on the world of blogging
because they were simple and succinct tools and helped people communicate
more efficiently.  however, sometimes, writing a lengthy post about
some particular topic without the constraints or associations that come
along with micro-blogging tools is really refreshing.  services like
tumblr and posterous also have brought blogging back from the depths
of hell.  and newer services like jekyll have given new life to the
ancient ways of blogging.

my very first blog was written in pure html, i remember using a tool
in 1996 called crisp which was a gui text editor on windows, it had
color coding and all that cool stuff.  later on after i graduated
from university, i dabbled with php and wrote my own blog service
using a lamp stack hosted on godaddy.  today i would like to unveil
my newest creation which leverages githubs pages and my very own
creation, metc, the meta compiler.
