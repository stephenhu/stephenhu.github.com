mockups, typically created by designers, are done using one of these
tools:  adobe illustrator, balsamiq, gomockingbird, powerpoint, visio, hand
drawing, etc.  quite honestly, i couldn't really tell you the difference between
mockups and wireframes, maybe wireframes are rough approximations with no
attention to colors, fonts, or any of the final visualization details while
mockups are close to the real thing.  but all of the above methods
are a bit too cumbersome to me, what i prefer these days, as designer and full
stack developer, is to directly write html, css, js, and bootstrap.  links are
hardcoded, some of the ajax requests and data are mocked so i'm actually interacting
with pretty much the final product down to the color.  this allows me to iterate
much more quickly and i'm also writing some of the code that eventually gets
templatized so i'm saving lots of cycles by not having to spin in yet another
tool that's really just a bunch of approximations.  and what better thing to do
than to use firebug or inspect element than to view a bunch of rulers with
margin width designations.

granted, this method is not as fast initially as a hand drawing, but it's a lot more
accurate.  i think in the grand scheme of things, you'll end up saving more
time than hand drawings because with a hand drawn mockup, you'd still have to
translate the drawings into html code.  i think the only real
argument about using html/css/js directly for mockups is that the designer
would have to have this skill set, but this is the 21st century, get with the
times man!
