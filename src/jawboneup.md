have been using the jawbone up lately, which is an activity tracker worn around your wrist.  jawbone is the company that brought stylish bluetooth ear pieces with equally stylish packaging and experience.  that ear piece had real state of the art technology like noise assassin or noise cancellation and just fit better than any earpiece i've ever used.  jawbone is also the maker of the jambone bluetooth speaker which i also bought, which serves as an external speaker and microphone, great for those long conference calls.  the company hasn't gone public yet, but has a number of interesting personal hardware products.

so the up is the first version of jawbone's activity tracker, but it feels quite complete and up to date in terms of a product, up24 is the second version which is out already, but you don't feel that you're really missing much, i think up is a very polished product.  basically up helps track number of steps taken, calories burned, distance moved, and sleep activity including light sleep, deep sleep, and number of times awake.  up tracks this with its built in accelerometer, similarly found in your iphone, which tracks the movements of your body to translate into steps.  i imagine if you don't swing your arms much when walking then you'll get some interesting results (have not tried yet).  the up doesn't have any visual display like an led so you have to download an app for your mobile phone (iphone and android).  the mobile app gives you charts and tracks your goals based on several factors such as age, weight, and height.  to sync data to your phone, the up requires you to physically take off the cap of the wristband which exposes a stereo mini jack that you then insert into your mobile phone headphone slot.  data syncing happens in seconds and this data also gets synchronized to jawbone's servers on the web so if you have multiple devices with the app, you're all centrally synchronized.

sleep activity is tracked by movement also, supposedly when in deep sleep there's less movement, light sleep is tracked as more movement.  in order to track sleep, you have to click on a button on the wristband which illuminates a blue colored half moon.  press it again and it toggles to a green colored five leaf shape like the hong kong flag which is awake mode.  i sometimes forget to toggle the button for sleep before bedtime, but since my sleep's been pretty lacking lately, i've been making a concerted effort to press the button to track all the intimate details and it's not that bad, you can do it based on feel, without even having to open your eyes.  pressing the button when waking up is less important because it tracks large movements probably over long time periods as being times when you're awake and automatically toggles.

overall i purchased a torquise large sized up band and wear it on my left wrist, it's really light and easy to take on and off, the wristband is quite durable (somewhat waterproof, definitely sweat proof) and doesn't bother me that much, then again i used to wear a really heavy metal wristwatch.  the battery lasts about 10 days which is not bad at all and the battery charges fully in minutes.  overall i'm quite impressed with jawbone's newest addition to their family of personal products.  i didn't think i really needed something to tell me how much sleep i'm getting, but the additional data that i get about deep versus light sleep is interesting, plus all the data i get about how active i'm being versus how active i need to be.  the main difference between the up24 is the look of the wristband and the fact that low powered bluetooth allows you to sync to a mobile phone wirelessly which also drains the battery a bit faster (9 versus 10 days).  i personally keep bluetooth disabled on my phone unless i really need it such as making a conference call with my jawbone ear piece, it drains the phone battery too quickly so the up24 actually requires just as much if not more process to synchronize data.  overall i'm quite happy with the up, don't regret not buying the up24 as both were available at the time of purchase.  the reason why i didn't buy an up24 was because they didn't have an up and i didn't know any better, but luckily i think i made the better purchase.

Update
------

I've been using the jawbone up for an additional 60 days and there have been several issues that i picked up, for one, while playing basketball with my competitive co-workers, one of them knocked into me by accident, i remember wincing for a brief moment, not because of the pain, but because it was close to my left wrist where my jawbone up lives, but the up was still securely attached to my wrist so i continued to play and disregarded the whole matter.  later on after leaving the gym, i noticed that the cap that covers the stereo mini jack was missing from my up, i didn't remember syncing or taking the thing off, so it dawned on me that it must have been that contact that knocked it off.  i didn't hear any sound of a plastic cap hitting the hardwood floor and the gym was far off and i had meetings in the afternoon to attend so wasn't about to head back, plus i could only imagine the janitor's behavior when picking up a small plastic piece, similar in size to a pen top (most likely thrown in the trash, not the lost and found), but at the same time i was thinking to myself how much the cap made the product, having the stereo mini sticking out like that just hurts the aesthetics of the jawbone up, plus at times the metal connector would touch my sweaty skin which felt like the same effect as you would get from sticking your tongue on the wrong end of a small battery.  there's probably no shock given from this and just my paranoia, but i had to remove the band from my wrist, it was getting too uncomfortable having a cold piece of metal touching me.  perhaps this is where the fitbit and nike wristbands tower over the up, the fact that it's a continuous band wrapped securly around your wrist, the up is a mere semi-circle that could fall off at any time.  and also since it's asymmetrical in nature, you run the risk of breaking if you pull on the two ends in opposite directions too hard, though my daughter with her brute 2 and half year old strength has tested this quite extensively with no issues, i liken the breaking point to a wish bone.

towards the last few days of usage of the jawbone up, perhaps due to my aggressive schedule and lack of sleep, there were many instances where i simply forgot to put the thing into sleep mode, remember this is a manual process.  i even made it a point after doing so far too often, to remember to add a step to my sleep routine, to put the thing to sleep mode once i got into bed.  i typically read right before going to bed, but it was just hard to remember, and i can remember the disappoint in not seeing the data to support my sleep efforts the following morning.

and the last complaint i have about the jawbone is the tightness around the wrist, i purchased a large and in general have fairly thin wrists for an adult male, i would notice that my left hand would feel a bit numb on some nights where i probably put too much weight on my left side.  perhaps the extra large size would help, it's like wearing a watch to bed.

overall, i think the jawbone up is not a good fit for usage in close contact sports, though i've played basketball 2-3 times while wearing my up with no issues.  walking, running, yoga, these types of activities seem ok.  so the only real value i was getting out of the up was tracking my steps during non-sporting, waking hours and sleep pattern, i tend to sit often unless it's the weekend and i'm out shopping or playing some type of sport, which is mostly contact based.  at the end of the day, most people can estimate how much time was spent sleeping with some simple arthmetic despite not being able to get information about deep versus light sleep, but a general rule of thumb is that some percentage of sleep is deep and it's pretty consistent.
