i'm watching this hbo series called boardwalk empire which talks about the
life of this corrupt atlantic city treasurer that's really just an irish gangster set
in the times of the prohibition period in america.  a really good show with excellent
casting (steve buscemi amongst others).  anyway, the story's pretty engaging
and the acting is quite excellent.  and i've always been a big fan of gangster/mafia
genres, but i tend to look at the movies now from the perspective of leadership
and management because gangsters are also good leaders and managers in their own right.  they often
times exhibit the skills necessary to lead and manage companies albeit some of
the methods used are a bit illegal, but in terms of the behaviors and attitudes
towards many situations are quite effective.  for example, high influence,
experienced resolving conflict, quick decision makers, tough negotiators, provide
instant feedback, operational excellence, good at creating hierarchy,
good at recruiting, good at making tough decisions, good vision, good awareness
of decision makers and stakeholders, good execution.
