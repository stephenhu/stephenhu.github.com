          <p>welcome, this is my very first blog post here!  i&#39;ve been blogging
          for a fairly long time, my very first blog was written in pure html
          back in my college days (circa &#39;96).  i still remember my first text
          editor, it was this gui called crisp that ran on windows, syntax
          highlighting and all!  later on, after graduating, i dabbled a little
          in php and wrote my own blogging app with mysql backend, this was
          all hosted from godaddy, i would upload new files using ftp to a
          linux server running apache in one of godaddy&#39;s datacenters, this
          server was probably hosting several hundred other sites as well.</p>
          
          <p>i had stopped blogging for some time around 2008 or so, part of the
          reasoning was probably because my domain expired, but also because
          micro-blogging tools like facebook and twitter had pretty much taken
          over as communication tools because they were quick and simple (granted
          these tools were blocked in china which is why i never really used these).
          however, sometimes, writing a lengthy post about some particular topic
          without the constraints or associations that come along with
          micro-blogging tools is actually quite refreshing.  tools like tumblr
          and posterous have made blogging easier, and static site generators
          like jekyll have brought back blogging in a new and interesting way.</p>
          
          <p>anyway, it&#39;s great to be back, and i&#39;m actually quite excited to be
          blogging again, and on top of that, i&#39;ve been working on a tool to
          help aide in the process called <a href="https://github.com/stephenhu/metc">metc</a>.</p>
