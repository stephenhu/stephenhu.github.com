        <h3>Mobile First</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Wed May 28 09:20:12 2014</date>
      <p>a lot of people in the high-tech industry have been talking about mobile
      first for a long time, the meaning behind this is quite literally to create mobile
      apps before you go with anything else, just think what the world would be like if
      uber (taxi mobile app) created a web app before even starting to create its mobile
      application, no gps functionality to tell drivers where you are, and you&#39;d have to
      have a computer or mobile browser to summon a taxi.  i think the biggest reason for
      going mobile first is because of the much more refined user experience on smartphones,
      you have the ability to leverage 3 of the 5 senses (visible, audible, and touchable),
      the screens are much smaller than computer monitors so designers are forced to use
      simpler layouts, and end users have more freedom with smartphones, compute anywhere.  web sites
      in general were built before the days of touch screen interfaces and at most leverage
      2 of the 5 senses (visual, auditory), they were built for computers with a clunky
      monitor, mouse, and keyboard, or a clunky laptop that will never be as easy to carry
      around as your smartphone.</p>
      
      <p>a counter argument would be that the number of users with smartphones is much less
      than the number of users with computers, but think of the target smartphone user,
      this is a user with some sophistication, potentially some spending power, with
      the need to leverage data services and applications everywhere, this is a very
      exciting user base!  gps and phone services also give applications more functionality
      over a personal computer.</p>
      
      <p>i long to see the days where all 5 senses can be leveraged by smartphones, the last
      two being smellable and tastable, we&#39;re already seeing some inroads being made with
      devices that help measure alcoholic intake and imagine some of the sensors from the
      public bathroom air freshner could be leveraged.  and i think the current 3 senses
      each have dimensions where innovation can take place, like for example audible senses,
      mostly this is input, we listen to music on our phones, we set alarms each day, and
      we can hear the feedback from pressing on buttons for applications, but things like
      speech recognition are still pretty weak for smartphones, sure there&#39;s siri and android
      provides lots of functionality, but just ask yourself how much your time is spent
      tapping on smartphone applications as opposed to speaking (what&#39;s up not counted).</p>

        <h3>Email Best Practices</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Wed May 28 09:20:06 2014</date>
      <p>email is a 20 year old technology, though because of its simplicity and usefulness,
      has stayed pretty consistent and still highly used all these years.  but because
      it&#39;s simple, there have been many usage patterns or mores that have grown about
      email and i will highlight some of the best practices, though this is more focused
      towards company (not personal) email:</p>
      
      <h2>Angry Email</h2>
      
      <p>Tone is hard to infer through email often times, so if you have something very
      personal to say, say it in person, don&#39;t send email.</p>
      
      <h2>Email Can Always Be Forwarded</h2>
      
      <p>A good rule of thumb is to never write anything you wouldn&#39;t want forwarded
      because most likely it will, this is a perfect example of murphy&#39;s law and
      goes along with the previous best practice.</p>
      
      <h2>Too Many Replies</h2>
      
      <p>If an email has more than 3 replies or threads, then it&#39;s no longer effective,
      email is supposed to be simple, asynchronous, and fast, there&#39;s free text format
      so you have enough space to put down your thoughts.  if you&#39;re going back
      and forth with multiple replies then that means the medium has lost its
      effectiveness and you probably should pick up the phone and talk.</p>
      
      <h2>Thank You Replies</h2>
      
      <p>I really dislike receiving thank you emails, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like being
      praised or recognized for my efforts, but I get on order of 50-100 emails a day,
      this just adds to the number and the processing time to get to the meat of the
      matter in my day.  I kind of like the social way of doing things by clicking
      a thanks or like button.</p>
      
      <h2>Email Groups</h2>
      
      <p>If you&#39;re a part of an email group, you have the responsibility to be a good
      citizen within the group.  I often times see people reply all for things
      like thank you emails.  Leverage the bcc feature.</p>
      
      <h2>Call out Bcc</h2>
      
      <p>Not sure what the original use case was in mind for bcc, it&#39;s definitely quite
      stealthy, but if you bcc someone for the effect of not wanting to get spam via
      people that reply all, you should also mention who you&#39;re bcc&#39;ing.</p>
      
      <h2>Adding or Removing Users</h2>
      
      <p>Ever get an email reply where someone was silently added to the list and then
      because you didn&#39;t know, replied with something that you shouldn&#39;t have?  You
      should always note changes to added or removed people in an email thread.</p>
      
      <h2>Epic Emails</h2>
      
      <p>Even though email is asynchronous and there are no real limitations to length
      of email, but it shouldn&#39;t be used to write lengthy articles, people can
      certainly ignore these emails, but with the increase in smartphones, these are
      just not sane.  there are better mediums for these types of things like blogs
      which could certainly be referenced via email.</p>

        <h3>Technology and China</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Wed May 28 09:19:58 2014</date>
      <p>you&#39;ve all probably played or seen the game civilization, the game where you start as a primitive
      culture and then through major technological and philosophical advancements, start to overtake your neighbors
      as you steam roll in tanks and democracy against their archers and feudalism.  and history itself has shown
      that you can&#39;t win a battle of guns versus swords.  over time, technology takes its toll on humanity and forces changes
      whether society is ready for it or not.  and even though china is now the world&#39;s second largest economy
      by gdp and spending power, and soon ready to overtake the states, much of the 1.3 billion population is
      still rather third-world country like, lowly educated with menial spending power and earnings potential.
      but what&#39;s happening here is really quite interesting, more so than a first world country like in the states
      where technological advancements have been happening over the past few decades at an exponential rate.</p>
      
      <p>in china, take a taxi driver, for example, in beijing or shanghai where there&#39;s upwards of 25 million
      population in the urban areas, you can find taxi&#39;s at all sorts of times in the day or night.  the average
      take home pay for a taxi driver was about 3000-5000 rmb per month, based on a 6 rmb to 1 usd ratio, we&#39;re
      talking about 500-950 usd per month.  just to give you some perspective, 500-950 usd a month in
      shanghai or beijing probably means you don&#39;t eat out that often, once or twice a month at most, you
      have a pretty small apartment in an old neighborhood, probably single bedroom in a sketchy part of town,
      40-60 square meters (~400-600 square feet), you don&#39;t save that much per month since food prices and prices
      of goods are on the rise, and most importantly, quality of life is relatively low since you&#39;re working 18-20 hour
      shifts every other day (15 days a month).  however, then comes a set of uber clones, uber&#39;s the taxi
      mobile app in america, in china there have been an explosion of these apps, most notably kuai di da che,
      di di da che, and huang feng, i think there&#39;s already been consolidation of these apps so that there are
      2 major ones, but i digress, my point is not that there are a lot of these types of cloned apps, but the causal
      effects that are happening at an alarming rate to society as this technology is starting to take shape.
      after introduction of these apps, taxi drivers in shanghai and beijing were quoted to be making about
      5000-7000 rmb per month over the last few months which is a 66% increase in pay!  the reason partially
      being that as a marketing ploy, the app makers were giving 5-10 rmb (~1-1.5 usd) per taxi ride to
      drivers, but also now taxi drivers could more intelligently route their days, i.e. instead of taking
      a random person to a random place, they could essentially pick and choose the best opportunity for profit,
      assuming they could win the bid.  but there&#39;s also another effect on society in china, there&#39;s a whole
      business centered around call centers, you could call 24/7 a hotline and get a taxi, basically there&#39;s
      some dispatcher that sends a broadcast to drivers and tries to manually triangulate the closest and
      most willing driver, this person then has to send an sms to the caller with license plate number,
      driver phone number, and estimated time of arrival.  these call centers are now being replaced by
      these apps, almost overnight.  i can&#39;t estimate how many people work at these call centers, but i
      imagine there&#39;s quite a few people that have relied on this as a job for many years.</p>
      
      <p>technology slowly starts to make changes to society, and the less educated will slowly start to
      see major changes to their lifestyles, china for the most part is still a human labor intensive
      economy, it thrives on lower cost, mass amounts of physical labor (lowly educated) which will
      become a large problem long term as other countries become cheaper.  i think the only thing going
      for china&#39;s labor market is not really cost because vietnam, bangladesh, indonesia, india, have much
      lower labor costs and currency valuations, but the sheer size of its population, even if vietnam
      is let&#39;s say 3x cheaper, the fact that you can probably get millions versus thousands of skilled
      laborers makes a huge difference.</p>
      
      <p>the evolution is only starting, there will be more innovations that will start to dramatically change
      society in china and other third world like countries, kind of an interesting place to be.  and i&#39;m
      certain as these changes take effect, the political system will have to evolve as well.</p>

        <h3>Jawbone Up</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Sun Apr 20 19:38:22 2014</date>
      <p><img src="https://dyzup8v06s4q5.cloudfront.net/ver/static/images/marketing/health/up/colorizer/up-band-sprite@2x.v2.png" alt="jawbone up"></p>
      
      <p>have been using the jawbone up lately, which is an activity tracker worn around your wrist.  jawbone is the company that brought stylish bluetooth ear pieces with equally stylish packaging and experience.  that ear piece had real state of the art technology like noise assassin or noise cancellation and just fit better than any earpiece i&#39;ve ever used.  jawbone is also the maker of the jambone bluetooth speaker which i also bought, which serves as an external speaker and microphone, great for those long conference calls.  the company hasn&#39;t gone public yet, but has a number of interesting personal hardware products.</p>
      
      <p>so the up is the first version of jawbone&#39;s activity tracker, but it feels quite complete and up to date in terms of a product, up24 is the second version which is out already, but you don&#39;t feel that you&#39;re really missing much, i think up is a very polished product.  basically up helps track number of steps taken, calories burned, distance moved, and sleep activity including light sleep, deep sleep, and number of times awake.  up tracks this with its built in accelerometer, similarly found in your iphone, which tracks the movements of your body to translate into steps.  i imagine if you don&#39;t swing your arms much when walking then you&#39;ll get some interesting results (have not tried yet).  the up doesn&#39;t have any visual display like an led so you have to download an app for your mobile phone (iphone and android).  the mobile app gives you charts and tracks your goals based on several factors such as age, weight, and height.  to sync data to your phone, the up requires you to physically take off the cap of the wristband which exposes a stereo mini jack that you then insert into your mobile phone headphone slot.  data syncing happens in seconds and this data also gets synchronized to jawbone&#39;s servers on the web so if you have multiple devices with the app, you&#39;re all centrally synchronized.</p>
      
      <p>sleep activity is tracked by movement also, supposedly when in deep sleep there&#39;s less movement, light sleep is tracked as more movement.  in order to track sleep, you have to click on a button on the wristband which illuminates a blue colored half moon.  press it again and it toggles to a green colored five leaf shape like the hong kong flag which is awake mode.  i sometimes forget to toggle the button for sleep before bedtime, but since my sleep&#39;s been pretty lacking lately, i&#39;ve been making a concerted effort to press the button to track all the intimate details and it&#39;s not that bad, you can do it based on feel, without even having to open your eyes.  pressing the button when waking up is less important because it tracks large movements probably over long time periods as being times when you&#39;re awake and automatically toggles.</p>
      
      <p>overall i purchased a torquise large sized up band and wear it on my left wrist, it&#39;s really light and easy to take on and off, the wristband is quite durable (somewhat waterproof, definitely sweat proof) and doesn&#39;t bother me that much, then again i used to wear a really heavy metal wristwatch.  the battery lasts about 10 days which is not bad at all and the battery charges fully in minutes.  overall i&#39;m quite impressed with jawbone&#39;s newest addition to their family of personal products.  i didn&#39;t think i really needed something to tell me how much sleep i&#39;m getting, but the additional data that i get about deep versus light sleep is interesting, plus all the data i get about how active i&#39;m being versus how active i need to be.  the main difference between the up24 is the look of the wristband and the fact that low powered bluetooth allows you to sync to a mobile phone wirelessly which also drains the battery a bit faster (9 versus 10 days).  i personally keep bluetooth disabled on my phone unless i really need it such as making a conference call with my jawbone ear piece, it drains the phone battery too quickly so the up24 actually requires just as much if not more process to synchronize data.  overall i&#39;m quite happy with the up, don&#39;t regret not buying the up24 as both were available at the time of purchase.  the reason why i didn&#39;t buy an up24 was because they didn&#39;t have an up and i didn&#39;t know any better, but luckily i think i made the better purchase.</p>
      
      <h2>Update</h2>
      
      <p>I&#39;ve been using the jawbone up for an additional 60 days and there have been several issues that i picked up, for one, while playing basketball with my competitive co-workers, one of them knocked into me by accident, i remember wincing for a brief moment, not because of the pain, but because it was close to my left wrist where my jawbone up lives, but the up was still securely attached to my wrist so i continued to play and disregarded the whole matter.  later on after leaving the gym, i noticed that the cap that covers the stereo mini jack was missing from my up, i didn&#39;t remember syncing or taking the thing off, so it dawned on me that it must have been that contact that knocked it off.  i didn&#39;t hear any sound of a plastic cap hitting the hardwood floor and the gym was far off and i had meetings in the afternoon to attend so wasn&#39;t about to head back, plus i could only imagine the janitor&#39;s behavior when picking up a small plastic piece, similar in size to a pen top (most likely thrown in the trash, not the lost and found), but at the same time i was thinking to myself how much the cap made the product, having the stereo mini sticking out like that just hurts the aesthetics of the jawbone up, plus at times the metal connector would touch my sweaty skin which felt like the same effect as you would get from sticking your tongue on the wrong end of a small battery.  there&#39;s probably no shock given from this and just my paranoia, but i had to remove the band from my wrist, it was getting too uncomfortable having a cold piece of metal touching me.  perhaps this is where the fitbit and nike wristbands tower over the up, the fact that it&#39;s a continuous band wrapped securly around your wrist, the up is a mere semi-circle that could fall off at any time.  and also since it&#39;s asymmetrical in nature, you run the risk of breaking if you pull on the two ends in opposite directions too hard, though my daughter with her brute 2 and half year old strength has tested this quite extensively with no issues, i liken the breaking point to a wish bone.</p>
      
      <p>towards the last few days of usage of the jawbone up, perhaps due to my aggressive schedule and lack of sleep, there were many instances where i simply forgot to put the thing into sleep mode, remember this is a manual process.  i even made it a point after doing so far too often, to remember to add a step to my sleep routine, to put the thing to sleep mode once i got into bed.  i typically read right before going to bed, but it was just hard to remember, and i can remember the disappoint in not seeing the data to support my sleep efforts the following morning.</p>
      
      <p>and the last complaint i have about the jawbone is the tightness around the wrist, i purchased a large and in general have fairly thin wrists for an adult male, i would notice that my left hand would feel a bit numb on some nights where i probably put too much weight on my left side.  perhaps the extra large size would help, it&#39;s like wearing a watch to bed.</p>
      
      <p>overall, i think the jawbone up is not a good fit for usage in close contact sports, though i&#39;ve played basketball 2-3 times while wearing my up with no issues.  walking, running, yoga, these types of activities seem ok.  so the only real value i was getting out of the up was tracking my steps during non-sporting, waking hours and sleep pattern, i tend to sit often unless it&#39;s the weekend and i&#39;m out shopping or playing some type of sport, which is mostly contact based.  at the end of the day, most people can estimate how much time was spent sleeping with some simple arthmetic despite not being able to get information about deep versus light sleep, but a general rule of thumb is that some percentage of sleep is deep and it&#39;s pretty consistent.</p>

        <h3>Gangsters as Leaders and Managers</h3>
      </a>

      <p>i&#39;m watching this hbo series called boardwalk empire which talks about the
      life of this corrupt atlantic city treasurer that&#39;s really just an irish gangster set
      in the times of the prohibition period in america.  a really good show with excellent
      casting (steve buscemi amongst others).  anyway, the story&#39;s pretty engaging
      and the acting is quite excellent.  and i&#39;ve always been a big fan of gangster/mafia
      genres, but i tend to look at the movies now from the perspective of leadership
      and management because gangsters are also good leaders and managers in their own right.  they often
      times exhibit the skills necessary to lead and manage companies albeit some of
      the methods used are a bit illegal, but in terms of the behaviors and attitudes
      towards many situations are quite effective.  for example, high influence,
      experienced resolving conflict, quick decision makers, tough negotiators, provide
      instant feedback, operational excellence, good at creating hierarchy,
      good at recruiting, good at making tough decisions, good vision, good awareness
      of decision makers and stakeholders, good execution.</p>

        <h3>Code Your Mockups</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Thu Feb 27 22:17:05 2014</date>
      <p>mockups, typically created by designers, are done using one of these
      tools:  adobe illustrator, balsamiq, gomockingbird, powerpoint, visio, hand
      drawing, etc.  quite honestly, i couldn&#39;t really tell you the difference between
      mockups and wireframes, maybe wireframes are rough approximations with no
      attention to colors, fonts, or any of the final visualization details while
      mockups are close to the real thing.  but all of the above methods
      are a bit too cumbersome to me, what i prefer these days, as designer and full
      stack developer, is to directly write html, css, js, and bootstrap.  links are
      hardcoded, some of the ajax requests and data are mocked so i&#39;m actually interacting
      with pretty much the final product down to the color.  this allows me to iterate
      much more quickly and i&#39;m also writing some of the code that eventually gets
      templatized so i&#39;m saving lots of cycles by not having to spin in yet another
      tool that&#39;s really just a bunch of approximations.  and what better thing to do
      than to use firebug or inspect element than to view a bunch of rulers with
      margin width designations.</p>
      
      <p>granted, this method is not as fast initially as a hand drawing, but it&#39;s a lot more
      accurate.  i think in the grand scheme of things, you&#39;ll end up saving more
      time than hand drawings because with a hand drawn mockup, you&#39;d still have to
      translate the drawings into html code.  i think the only real
      argument about using html/css/js directly for mockups is that the designer
      would have to have this skill set, but this is the 21st century, get with the
      times man!</p>

        <h3>No More Mac Pros</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Tue Feb 11 20:53:21 2014</date>
      <p>the mac pro is the desktop/workstation class offering from apple which actually featured
      the very first intel processor ever for apple, all prior workstations (and laptops)
      featured the powerpc chip from motorola, this was a huge announcement and shift
      in apple&#39;s history.  i&#39;ve owned macs since the very first powermac g4 (powerpc
      processor) which was quite a good machine, however, it was running mac os 9.
      mac os x (10.0) was first released running on the quicksilver powermac g4
      which was a completely unusable operating system that had little to no
      native software built for it, you could basically run os 9 in emulation mode and there
      was plenty of software for that, but everything else was purely experimental.  later on,
      10.1 came out that made things better, more native software and developers had jumped
      onto the apple bandwagon semi-full force.  a few years later, i sold my quicksilver
      and purchased a mirrored door powermac g4, this machine was pretty cool, a dual
      processor workstation where at the time very few were to be had.  i had a diy server
      that i pieced together based on a tyan motherboard with 2 sockets for dual pentium 3
      cpu&#39;s, but anything else from a hardware manufacturer was completely out of my price
      range.  in the end, i ran the mirrored door to the ground (power supply failed) and
      due to the design of the case, the power supply wasn&#39;t something that you could replace
      with something from newegg.  there were other issues with the powermac being very picky
      about the memory type (usually ended in kernel panics if you bought the wrong type)
      and the fact that you couldn&#39;t replace graphics cards with off the shelf parts made
      the machine less impressive.  the final push over the edge was the fact that the
      file system was incompatible (hfs) and i couldn&#39;t get my files off the system
      without fixing the machine so i decided to move away from mac, this was the time
      when linux was making a big splash so i decided to go with another home made monster.</p>
      
      <p>it wasn&#39;t until the mac pro came out that i decided to switch back, here i was
      hoping that the system would use off the shelf parts and get rid of some of the
      nuttiness from the previous generations.  boy was i wrong, the same old nuttiness,
      memory timing issues with non-mac memory, incompatibility with off the shelf pci-x
      graphics cards, and even worse, this machine was purchased in 2006, and i found
      out that the operating system can&#39;t be upgraded to the latest mac os x mavericks.  the
      reason is because the mac pro 1 1 runs EFI32 bit firmware which can only boot
      32 bit operating systems.  mac os x made the switch over in 10.8 to full 64 bit
      support which made the mac pro 1 1 incompatible.  the machine is fully capable,
      11 GB of ram (16 GB total), dual quad-core processors (64 bit enabled), and still boasts
      excellent performance, but because of this silly firmware issue, is really a
      piece of garbage.  i have no upgrade path to the latest os x version and i can&#39;t
      even install 64 bit windows or linux operating systems.</p>
      
      <p>at this point, i&#39;m fed up with macs, at least workstations, the whole concept
      of the workstation is to be able to upgrade the machines.  the new mac pro
      sports an interesting cylindrical shape which looks nice, but i question how
      upgradeable this machine will be.  using apple hardware for laptops is alright
      since the upgrades are really incremental and not complete replacements, but
      i&#39;m giving up on mac workstations.  not only is the cost really ridiculous, i
      could probably get the same power in a setup that costs a third less.</p>

        <h3>Playstation 4 and the New Gaming Industry</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Thu Feb  6 10:37:43 2014</date>
      <p><img src="http://cdn.us.playstation.com/pscomauth/groups/public/documents/webasset/ps4-hrdware-large1.jpg" alt="Playstation 4"></p>
      
      <p>playstation 4 launched in mid-november of last year (2013), this is almost 20 years
      after the initial launch of the product and 8 years after the launch of its
      predecessor, the playstation 3, and 14 years after the venerable playstation 2.
      supplies are limited across the world, however, the us version is starting to
      become more widely available, but in essence, there&#39;s no greater time like now
      for sony to pick up the pace in an all new gaming world.</p>
      
      <p>i can&#39;t be 100% certain, but if i recall correctly, sony invented the marketing
      tactic to increase pent up demand by releasing limited quantities of product.
      this seems to be employed by apple and other companies these days, granted there&#39;s
      a real lag in being able to mass produce sophisticated products such as electronics,
      but i would imagine most companies of the time would wait until the manafacturing
      caught up before starting the marketing campaign.  playstation 2 came out in
      mid-november of 2000 and this was the first gaming console with dvd support
      which would boost the storage capacity for games meaning better graphics.  people
      would line up overnight just to be on the waiting list to purchase a console,
      this was also during the beginning of winter which meant frigid temperatures,
      there were even a few instances of fights breaking out to get one of these
      consoles, i believe.  overall this tactic is great for gaming companies because
      this allows the software companies to invest the time in creating better games,
      the ps4 doesn&#39;t have any spectacular games at the moment, all the great ones
      will be coming a few months later.  this is similar to the playstation 2 launch
      except that the playstation 2 is backwards compatible with playstation games,
      and playstation 3 is compatible with all previous generation console games, the
      playstation 4 is not compatible with any previous console games.  this is a bit
      of a strange decision by sony to break all compatibility, but part of this was
      because of the strange decision to use the cell processor in the playstation 3
      which is a completely different computer architecture from the x86-64 instruction
      set in the playstation 4, the only way to create backwards compatibility is to
      use an emulator which would make performance a real issue.  anyway, without
      any killer games, there&#39;s really no rush at the moment to purchase a playstation
      4, all current games can be purchased for playstation 3 as well (at a lower
      price).</p>
      
      <p>in terms of compatibility the recently released microsoft console, xbox one,
      also doesn&#39;t support games from the previous console, xbox 360, which is again,
      a very odd decision.  unlike the playstation 3, the xbox 360 is also leveraging
      the x86 instruction set architecture, so perhaps this is more of a marketing
      decision to push game makers to make games on the latest console.  the hardware
      specifications for the xbox one and playstation 4 are similar, both sport x86-64
      processors from amd and radeon graphics processors.  what really will set the two
      consoles apart will be the games.  however, i contend that the real challenge
      will be from the mass entry of games from tablets and mobile phones which offers
      a bit of a different gaming experience at a fraction of the cost.  some of the
      games on iphone, for example, can compete in terms of graphics capabilities
      and gameplay with those on a  console, however, the experience of having at
      your fingertips, the ability to game anywhere almost anytime while being
      connected will really challenge the legacies of playstation and xbox.  i also
      see the company valve, the maker of the steam which can be installed on diy
      commodity x86 hardware as a real game changer.  the diy community is very adept
      at upgrading hardware to get more gaming power while the console makers are
      pretty much stuck with current generation hardware.  valve doesn&#39;t have a very
      good mobile story at the moment though which puts them at a major disadvantage.</p>
      
      <p>apple and google&#39;s model really change the dynamics of the gaming industry,
      the lower cost of games, often times free compared to 59.99 usd for console
      games, and access from anywhere is really disrupting.  microsoft and sony still
      believe there&#39;s a vibrant community of people that prefer the hardcore
      experience of sitting in a living room, but is this market enough or just a
      niche that will eventually bring the console makers to become obsolete?</p>

        <h3>Experiences with Airbnb</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Tue Feb  4 13:08:25 2014</date>
      <p><img src="https://a0.muscache.com/airbnb/static/about/resources/airbnb-logo-293-1d7ea0761fc6bc1efde1d6e706479392.png" alt="Airbnb"></p>
      
      <p>i first found airbnb on hacker news, the idea didn&#39;t seem that novel, i.e. i
      wasn&#39;t blown away by the technology or business model, more so that i needed
      a nice place to stay and the traditional hotel booking sites never made me feel
      like i was getting the best deal, having a middle man only adds cost.  for those
      not familiar with airbnb, they&#39;re a startup company in the bay area that
      essentially allows you to rent out your room, apartment, or house by the day
      (or month), just like a hotel.  airbnb provides professional photographers
      to help create the best looking images for free.  in return,
      airbnb takes a cut of the rental price and plays as a trusted escrow service.
      like i said, the idea&#39;s not particularly profound despite what the venture
      capitalists are raving about.  anyway, my point&#39;s not really about the startup,
      but more about the service.  my use case is extremely simple, i&#39;m looking for
      highly affordable places to stay via a web app that&#39;s easy to use so that i can
      avoid having to use abominable sites such as orbitz, expedia, ctrip, etc.  these
      trips are typically personal trips so i&#39;m extremely budget conscious, yet
      obviously looking for high value.  i would like to mention that hipmunk is
      an aggregator service, similar to orbitz, expedia, etc, but it does sport
      a much nicer lightweight web app experience in general, however, it&#39;s still
      nothing more than an aggregator and the deals aren&#39;t that great, i.e. how
      much of a discount am i really getting when compared to going directly to
      the provider by using hipmunk.</p>
      
      <p>my first experience with airbnb was quite positive, i was setting up yet
      another shopping excursion to hong kong so location was pretty much everything,
      no point in lugging lots of shopping bags around town all day, something near
      all the good shopping places, clean, and affordable (no point in spending
      several hundreds on a place if all you&#39;re going to do is sleep and shower).  the
      user interface for airbnb is quite simplified, search based on location and
      filters, and the images of the apartments were quite detailed to the point where
      i felt i had a pretty good idea of what i was getting into for each rental.
      in hong kong, there are few houses, mostly apartments and studios.  a lot of
      hosts seemed to be either renting their own place out or some serious landlords
      trying to run a business.  the girl i rented from was a local resident of hong
      kong, educated in america (yale), probably either on business travel or
      vacation, so when we arrived, we basically crashed at her place while she was
      out, all her personal belongings were there, it felt kind of strange seeing
      her travel wish list on the refrigerator door, personal photos, her closet
      full of luxury bags and clothes, or even the dirty laundry (yes, including
      underwear).  i couldn&#39;t tell if the sheets were clean, but the bed was made
      and everything seemed in order.  most hosts have cleaning service before you
      arrive, but i imagine the management of these services is pretty loosely
      defined.  i take it that sheraton cleans all of their sheets, but airbnb
      cleaning lady, probably not.  i&#39;m highly allergic to pet dander so i was
      really afraid of there being past tenants with dogs or cats especially since
      a lot of users of airbnb seem to be hipsters.  and i was constantly thinking
      how dirty the sheets were, you can basically see all the past tenants that left
      reviews for the place in the web app, pictures and profiles.  all in all
      though, the place was convenient, well priced, and clean enough.  i will have
      to say that my second experience was god awful, don&#39;t expect airbnb hosts to be
      as responsive as hotel clerks, sometimes the landlord doesn&#39;t even
      respond to your inquiry, but you have to wait a full 24 hours before figuring
      out that you&#39;re not able to book a place (cancellation of a request doesn&#39;t
      incur penalty).  these are not professional landlords, i assume these people
      have day jobs and also go on vacation sometimes to places where there&#39;s no
      internet access, so there&#39;s no telling if they&#39;ll even get to your request
      in time.  also, i would rate cleanliness of airbnb properties as pretty poor,
      probably case by case, but in general, not up to 3 star hotel standards.  the
      price difference was quite astounding though, we stayed for about 700 hkd/night,
      this was during china&#39;s national holiday in october which is high tide and
      hotels were easily going for 1400 hkd/night in the same area.  and the
      amenities can be greater than a hotel, for example, this studio had a nintendo
      wii, dvd player, ipad, a full library of dvds, and full kitchen including
      utensils.</p>
      
      <p>i think for my use case, airbnb&#39;s not the greatest fit, to find affordable
      housing on short notice and fast response time; however, there are possibilities
      to live in pretty nice places that you&#39;d normally not be able to live by way
      of hotel, take for example a house on the beach with full amenities like outdoor
      grill.  airbnb really goes off the beaten path and does open up opportunities for
      some nice adventures, but the consistency and service level is really not up
      to my standards.  again, all of my experiences are from a traveller&#39;s perspective
      looking for an entire house/studio/apartment to rent and i have not used
      airbnb to host travellers, not sure if i like people going through my personal
      things.</p>

        <h3>China 4G</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Sat Feb  1 09:28:21 2014</date>
      <p><img src="http://www.hk.chinamobile.com/export/system/modules/com.cmhk.page.template.common/resources/en/images/logo.png" alt="China Mobile"></p>
      
      <p>china mobile is the world&#39;s largest mobile carrier with over 700m users.  when
      i moved to china in 2007, there were two other carriers, China Unicom and China
      Telecom, service was limited to 2g (GSM/CDMA/EDGE), but neither was even worthy
      of consideration, both carriers&#39; service and phone selection were really
      sub-standard at the time so pretty much everyone used china mobile.  then came
      3g service, china unicom was first to market in china and they leveraged the
      3g standard that was most prevalent in europe, wcdma.  china telecom went with
      cdma2000 (us standard) and china mobile was forced by the government to
      develop and research the homegrown td-cdma standard.  the chinese telecom
      industry is riddled with a lot of history, but the short summary is that the
      telecom industry used to be fully owned by the government and known as china
      telecom, sometime later china mobile and china unicom were spun off and all
      three companies were privatized.  large portions of all three companies are
      still owned and regulated by the government, but they act as separate
      companies for the most part.</p>
      
      <p>china unicom took early adopters advantage by pushing out their 3g service
      coupled with a great partnership with apple, iphones were subsidized heavily
      (often times free with a long term contract), and china unicom was the only
      player in town that had 3g service for the iphone in the beginning.  later
      on china telecom and china mobile came out with iphone support, but china
      mobile leveraged the super slow and problematic td-cdma technology.</p>
      
      <p>today, a majority of chinese users still leverage 2g services for simple
      phone and text messaging, yet there&#39;s a growing consumer base that requires
      higher bandwidth for all the new mobile apps.</p>
      
      <p>some say that china mobile&#39;s market share was hit hard by the advent of china
      unicom&#39;s iphone and 3g combination, however, i think china unicom and telecom
      spent significant amounts of money for 3g infrastructure, which at the time
      (2012) was already starting to phase out.  in my opinion, china mobile
      purposely invested big on getting 4g out the door before their competitors,
      and curbed spending on 3g.  and on jan 17, 2014 china mobile launched 4g
      services which beat unicom and telecom by many months.</p>
      
      <p>4g is promising technology, and china mobile&#39;s td-lte offering, again
      homegrown technology, has been touted as quite comparable to foreign offerings.
      i&#39;ve actually been fortunate enough to test this in hangzhou while on a cab,
      basically i can watch movies in high definition without any lag.  i&#39;ve been
      a long time china unicom user (since the iphone 4 came out in 2012), and the
      3g service has been just good enough to run some of my apps, however, watching
      movies has been completely inconceivable.  i also find that china unicom&#39;s
      network coverage is really spotty, often times the signal being really weak
      (0-1 bar even in the most populated big cities like beijing and shanghai).</p>
      
      <p>i plopped down for china mobile&#39;s 4g service just to test the waters since i
      had reasonably good experiences with china mobile&#39;s 2g offering and purchased a mifi
      router.  apple (or china mobile) finally conceded and decided to work together
      to offer the iphone 5s/5c on china mobile&#39;s 4g network, however, currently
      you can only find 16 gb models, my pictures already exceed 16 gb!  so i&#39;m
      going to wait until the 64 gb model comes out and the network coverage
      slowly increases.  to this day, i still think china unicom&#39;s coverage is poor,
      but china mobile should have much more funding to invest in proliferation of
      its physical network.  in consolation, if there&#39;s signal, the speed of 4g
      in china is so far so good, movies don&#39;t lag at all.  i&#39;ve also heard that
      china unicom and telecom will lease some of the 4g network from china mobile
      while trying to get approval to use foreign 4g network technologies.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Laptop</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Fri Jan 24 07:05:40 2014</date>
      <p>i&#39;ve been using macbooks for a very long time, my current one from work is
      a fully spec&#39;d out macbook pro retina, 15&quot; screen, 512 gb ssd, 16 gb ram,
      i7 quad core running at 2.7 ghz, a very well built piece of machinery from
      both inside and out, however, it&#39;s a work machine and there&#39;s incredibly
      crufty software put on the thing.  i also owned the very first intel based macbook, the
      black plastic one, and before that, i had purchased several (used) powerbooks based
      on the powerpc processor.  before the macbook craze, one of my favorite
      laptops was the one i received from my first job at hp, it was an hp business
      laptop (can&#39;t remember the model), i opted for an extra battery instead of
      the cd drive which gave me 2 batteries and, at the time, 3-4 hours of battery life which was
      truly unheard of, this was a time when the pentium m processor
      was king, basically an offshoot of the pentium 3 with more power savings.
      (i digress, but the pentium 4 was a new architecture compared to the pentium
      m, but there were energy efficiency issues with the 4 that made the m look
      really good in comparison.)  in between i&#39;ve owned several thinkpads, a netbook
      or 2 and several tablets.</p>
      
      <p>since my initial use of laptops back in 2000 to now, suffice to say, my
      requirements have changed quite dramatically, and, not to mention, the
      technology&#39;s also gotten much, much better.  from a work perspective, i am
      a managing director, but i still keep very close to software development and
      haven&#39;t stopped coding, ever (during non-work hours of course).  so for work, my primary
      use cases are for things like email, office apps (powerpoint, word, excel), some
      browser apps, virtualization (on a rare occassion to install some software
      for various platforms), and some new-fangled apps like evernote, dropbox,
      webex, skype, etc.  screen real estate comes secondary to mobility and ease
      of carrying around from conference room to conference room.  battery life
      plays a critical role, though i think i can get by on 4-5 hours now which
      most laptops today can handle with ease especially since i&#39;m not really doing
      much with the cpu&#39;s like compiling stuff or rendering video.  back in the olden
      days, i&#39;d probably do everything on my laptop, work, play, etc.  now with things
      like ipads, most of the playing has transitioned over and really the focus can
      be 100% on work.  the only problem is that i live a double life, after work,
      i code a bit.  and because mobile apps have become quite popular, i imagine
      i&#39;ll get to that ios app i&#39;ve always been wanting to make which means that i
      need a mac os x based system.  but the coding that i do these days doesn&#39;t
      require compiling, mostly interpreted languages like ruby and then things
      like html/css/js.  i still like to develop in linux, terminal vi style, but
      i also like having a friendly desktop environment like mac os x or windows
      that just makes things easy.  and most of the development that i do these days
      is for distributed web systems, the ability to deploy multiple linux servers
      is a must, this means that i need a hardcore cpu and lots, and lots of memory.
      video cards are not that critical anymore as i don&#39;t play high resolution
      games, so long as it can dual output in high definition to an external display.</p>
      
      <p>as time passes, i find that i&#39;m more accepting of what i&#39;ll deem polyware,
      multiple pieces of hardware, i used to want 1 machine to rule them all, but i&#39;m finding
      that that&#39;s a bit of a hard reality at the moment.  i like my ipad for watching
      movies, playing games, surfing the web, i like my iphone for phone, email,
      text, and social networking, i like my workstation for doing hardcore development and cramming lots
      of spinning disks, and having laptops for work mobility.  i&#39;ve decided that i need
      separate laptops for work and home, there are lots of tools to help synchronize
      things and it&#39;s analogous to having multiple (paper) notebooks to house different
      notes from different classes.</p>
      
      <p>so my ideal laptop is pretty much the macbook air 11&quot; except that the maximum
      memory configuration is 8 gb, i need at least 16 gb, 32 gb would be nice, but
      i imagine that would impact the power requirements.  it&#39;d be nice if they
      could get rid of the frame around the screen and give retina quality output
      on the local display.  i don&#39;t need touchscreen or any of the nonsensical things
      that microsoft&#39;s putting forth, a card reader slot would be nice, and at least
      2 usb slots would be icing on the cake.  i&#39;ll probably wait an iteration or 2
      of the macbook air, for now i&#39;ll just stick with the oblong retina macbook pro.</p>

        <h3>Welcome</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Fri Jan 24 07:05:35 2014</date>
      <p>welcome, this is my very first blog post here!  i&#39;ve been blogging
      for a fairly long time, my very first blog was written in pure html
      back in my college days (circa &#39;96).  i still remember my first text
      editor, it was this gui called crisp that ran on windows, syntax
      highlighting and all!  later on, after graduating, i dabbled a little
      in php and wrote my own blogging app with mysql backend, this was
      all hosted from godaddy, i would upload new files using ftp to a
      linux server running apache in one of godaddy&#39;s datacenters, this
      server was probably hosting several hundred other sites as well.</p>
      
      <p>i had stopped blogging for some time around 2008 or so, part of the
      reasoning was probably because my domain expired, but also because
      micro-blogging tools like facebook and twitter had pretty much taken
      over as communication tools because they were quick and simple (granted
      these tools were blocked in china which is why i never really used these).
      however, sometimes, writing a lengthy post about some particular topic
      without the constraints or associations that come along with
      micro-blogging tools is actually quite refreshing.  tools like tumblr
      and posterous have made blogging easier, and static site generators
      like jekyll have brought back blogging in a new and interesting way.</p>
      
      <p>anyway, it&#39;s great to be back, and i&#39;m actually quite excited to be
      blogging again, and on top of that, i&#39;ve been working on a tool to
      help aide in the process called <a href="https://github.com/stephenhu/meta">meta</a>.</p>
