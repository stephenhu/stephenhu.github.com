        <h3>Ideal Laptop</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Fri Jan 24 07:05:40 2014</date>
      <p>i&#39;ve been using macbooks for a very long time, my current one from work is
      a fully spec&#39;d out macbook pro retina, 15&quot; screen, 512 gb ssd, 16 gb ram,
      i7 quad core running at 2.7 ghz, a very well built piece of machinery from
      both inside and out, however, it&#39;s a work machine and there&#39;s incredibly
      crufty software put on the thing.  i also owned the very first intel based macbook, the
      black plastic one, and before that, i had purchased several (used) powerbooks based
      on the powerpc processor.  before the macbook craze, one of my favorite
      laptops was the one i received from my first job at hp, it was an hp business
      laptop (can&#39;t remember the model), i opted for an extra battery instead of
      the cd drive which gave me 2 batteries and, at the time, 3-4 hours of battery life which was
      truly unheard of, this was a time when the pentium m processor
      was king, basically an offshoot of the pentium 3 with more power savings.
      (i digress, but the pentium 4 was a new architecture compared to the pentium
      m, but there were energy efficiency issues with the 4 that made the m look
      really good in comparison.)  in between i&#39;ve owned several thinkpads, a netbook
      or 2 and several tablets.</p>
      
      <p>since my initial use of laptops back in 2000 to now, suffice to say, my
      requirements have changed quite dramatically, and, not to mention, the
      technology&#39;s also gotten much, much better.  from a work perspective, i am
      a managing director, but i still keep very close to software development and
      haven&#39;t stopped coding, ever (during non-work hours of course).  so for work, my primary
      use cases are for things like email, office apps (powerpoint, word, excel), some
      browser apps, virtualization (on a rare occassion to install some software
      for various platforms), and some new-fangled apps like evernote, dropbox,
      webex, skype, etc.  screen real estate comes secondary to mobility and ease
      of carrying around from conference room to conference room.  battery life
      plays a critical role, though i think i can get by on 4-5 hours now which
      most laptops today can handle with ease especially since i&#39;m not really doing
      much with the cpu&#39;s like compiling stuff or rendering video.  back in the olden
      days, i&#39;d probably do everything on my laptop, work, play, etc.  now with things
      like ipads, most of the playing has transitioned over and really the focus can
      be 100% on work.  the only problem is that i live a double life, after work,
      i code a bit.  and because mobile apps have become quite popular, i imagine
      i&#39;ll get to that ios app i&#39;ve always been wanting to make which means that i
      need a mac os x based system.  but the coding that i do these days doesn&#39;t
      require compiling, mostly interpreted languages like ruby and then things
      like html/css/js.  i still like to develop in linux, terminal vi style, but
      i also like having a friendly desktop environment like mac os x or windows
      that just makes things easy.  and most of the development that i do these days
      is for distributed web systems, the ability to deploy multiple linux servers
      is a must, this means that i need a hardcore cpu and lots, and lots of memory.
      video cards are not that critical anymore as i don&#39;t play high resolution
      games, so long as it can dual output in high definition to an external display.</p>
      
      <p>as time passes, i find that i&#39;m more accepting of what i&#39;ll deem polyware,
      multiple pieces of hardware, i used to want 1 machine to rule them all, but i&#39;m finding
      that that&#39;s a bit of a hard reality at the moment.  i like my ipad for watching
      movies, playing games, surfing the web, i like my iphone for phone, email,
      text, and social networking, i like my workstation for doing hardcore development and cramming lots
      of spinning disks, and having laptops for work mobility.  i&#39;ve decided that i need
      separate laptops for work and home, there are lots of tools to help synchronize
      things and it&#39;s analogous to having multiple (paper) notebooks to house different
      notes from different classes.</p>
      
      <p>so my ideal laptop is pretty much the macbook air 11&quot; except that the maximum
      memory configuration is 8 gb, i need at least 16 gb, 32 gb would be nice, but
      i imagine that would impact the power requirements.  it&#39;d be nice if they
      could get rid of the frame around the screen and give retina quality output
      on the local display.  i don&#39;t need touchscreen or any of the nonsensical things
      that microsoft&#39;s putting forth, a card reader slot would be nice, and at least
      2 usb slots would be icing on the cake.  i&#39;ll probably wait an iteration or 2
      of the macbook air, for now i&#39;ll just stick with the oblong retina macbook pro.</p>

        <h3>Welcome</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Fri Jan 24 07:05:35 2014</date>
      <p>welcome, this is my very first blog post here!  i&#39;ve been blogging
      for a fairly long time, my very first blog was written in pure html
      back in my college days (circa &#39;96).  i still remember my first text
      editor, it was this gui called crisp that ran on windows, syntax
      highlighting and all!  later on, after graduating, i dabbled a little
      in php and wrote my own blogging app with mysql backend, this was
      all hosted from godaddy, i would upload new files using ftp to a
      linux server running apache in one of godaddy&#39;s datacenters, this
      server was probably hosting several hundred other sites as well.</p>
      
      <p>i had stopped blogging for some time around 2008 or so, part of the
      reasoning was probably because my domain expired, but also because
      micro-blogging tools like facebook and twitter had pretty much taken
      over as communication tools because they were quick and simple (granted
      these tools were blocked in china which is why i never really used these).
      however, sometimes, writing a lengthy post about some particular topic
      without the constraints or associations that come along with
      micro-blogging tools is actually quite refreshing.  tools like tumblr
      and posterous have made blogging easier, and static site generators
      like jekyll have brought back blogging in a new and interesting way.</p>
      
      <p>anyway, it&#39;s great to be back, and i&#39;m actually quite excited to be
      blogging again, and on top of that, i&#39;ve been working on a tool to
      help aide in the process called <a href="https://github.com/stephenhu/meta">meta</a>.</p>

        <h3>China 4G</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Tue Jan 14 03:58:12 2014</date>
      <p>china mobile is the world&#39;s largest mobile carrier with over 700m users.  when
      i moved to china in 2007, there were two other carriers, China Unicom and China
      Telecom, service was limited to 2g (GSM/CDMA/EDGE), but neither was even worthy
      of consideration, both carriers&#39; service and phone selection were really
      sub-standard at the time so pretty much everyone used china mobile.  then came
      3g service, china unicom was first to market in china and they leveraged the
      3g standard that was most prevalent in europe, wcdma.  china telecom went with
      cdma2000 (us standard) and china mobile was forced by the government to
      develop and research the homegrown td-cdma standard.  the chinese telecom
      industry is riddled with a lot of history, but the short summary is that the
      telecom industry used to be fully owned by the government and known as china
      telecom, sometime later china mobile and china unicom were spun off and all
      three companies were privatized.  large portions of all three companies are
      still owned and regulated by the government, but they act as separate
      companies for the most part.</p>
      
      <p>china unicom took early adopters advantage by pushing out their 3g service
      coupled with a great partnership with apple, iphones were subsidized heavily
      (often times free with a long term contract), and china unicom was the only
      player in town that had 3g service for the iphone in the beginning.  later
      on china telecom and china mobile came out with iphone support, but china
      mobile leveraged the super slow and problematic td-cdma technology.</p>
      
      <p>today, a majority of chinese users still leverage 2g services for simple
      phone and text messaging, yet there&#39;s a growing consumer base that requires
      higher bandwidth for all the new mobile apps.</p>
      
      <p>some say that china mobile&#39;s market share was hit hard by the advent of china
      unicom&#39;s iphone and 3g combination, however, i think china unicom and telecom
      spent significant amounts of money for 3g infrastructure, which at the time
      (2012) was already starting to phase out.  in my opinion, china mobile
      purposely invested big on getting 4g out the door before their competitors,
      and curbed spending on 3g.  and on jan 17, 2014 china mobile launched 4g
      services which beat unicom and telecom by many months.</p>
      
      <p>4g is promising technology, and china mobile&#39;s td-lte offering, again
      homegrown technology, has been touted as quite comparable to foreign offerings.
      i&#39;ve actually been fortunate enough to test this in hangzhou while on a cab,
      basically i can watch movies in high definition without any lag.  i&#39;ve been
      a long time china unicom user (since the iphone 4 came out in 2012), and the
      3g service has been just good enough to run some of my apps, however, watching
      movies has been completely inconceivable.  i also find that china unicom&#39;s
      network coverage is really spotty, often times the signal being really weak
      (0-1 bar even in the most populated big cities like beijing and shanghai).</p>
      
      <p>i plopped down for china mobile&#39;s 4g service just to test the waters since i
      had reasonably good experiences with china mobile&#39;s 2g offering and purchased a mifi
      router.  apple (or china mobile) finally conceded and decided to work together
      to offer the iphone 5s/5c on china mobile&#39;s 4g network, however, currently
      you can only find 16 gb models, my pictures already exceed 16 gb!  so i&#39;m
      going to wait until the 64 gb model comes out and the network coverage
      slowly increases.  to this day, i still think china unicom&#39;s coverage is poor,
      but china mobile should have much more funding to invest in proliferation of
      its physical network.  in consolation, if there&#39;s signal, the speed of 4g
      in china is so far so good, movies don&#39;t lag at all.  i&#39;ve also heard that
      china unicom and telecom will lease some of the 4g network from china mobile
      while trying to get approval to use foreign 4g network technologies.</p>
