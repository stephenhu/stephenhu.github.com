        <h3>Gangsters as Leaders and Managers</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Thu Feb 27 22:42:25 2014</date>
      <p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/Boardwalk_Empire_2010_Intertitle.png" alt="Boardwalk Empire"></p>
      
      <p>i&#39;m watching this hbo series called boardwalk empire which talks about the
      life of this corrupt atlantic city treasurer that&#39;s really just an irish gangster set
      in the times of the prohibition period in america.  a really good show with excellent
      casting (steve buscemi amongst others).  anyway, the story&#39;s pretty engaging
      and the acting is quite excellent.  and i&#39;ve always been a big fan of gangster/mafia
      genres, but i tend to look at the movies now from the perspective of leadership
      and management because gangsters are also good leaders and managers in their own right.  they often
      times exhibit the skills necessary to lead and manage companies albeit some of
      the methods used are a bit illegal, but in terms of the behaviors and attitudes
      towards many situations are quite effective.  for example, high influence,
      experienced resolving conflict, quick decision makers, tough negotiators, provide
      instant feedback, operational excellence, good at creating hierarchy,
      good at recruiting, good at making tough decisions, good vision, good awareness
      of decision makers and stakeholders, good execution.</p>

        <h3>Code Your Mockups</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Thu Feb 27 22:17:05 2014</date>
      <p>mockups, typically created by designers, are done using one of these
      tools:  adobe illustrator, balsamiq, gomockingbird, powerpoint, visio, hand
      drawing, etc.  quite honestly, i couldn&#39;t really tell you the difference between
      mockups and wireframes, maybe wireframes are rough approximations with no
      attention to colors, fonts, or any of the final visualization details while
      mockups are close to the real thing.  but all of the above methods
      are a bit too cumbersome to me, what i prefer these days, as designer and full
      stack developer, is to directly write html, css, js, and bootstrap.  links are
      hardcoded, some of the ajax requests and data are mocked so i&#39;m actually interacting
      with pretty much the final product down to the color.  this allows me to iterate
      much more quickly and i&#39;m also writing some of the code that eventually gets
      templatized so i&#39;m saving lots of cycles by not having to spin in yet another
      tool that&#39;s really just a bunch of approximations.  and what better thing to do
      than to use firebug or inspect element than to view a bunch of rulers with
      margin width designations.</p>
      
      <p>granted, this method is not as fast initially as a hand drawing, but it&#39;s a lot more
      accurate.  i think in the grand scheme of things, you&#39;ll end up saving more
      time than hand drawings because with a hand drawn mockup, you&#39;d still have to
      translate the drawings into html code.  i think the only real
      argument about using html/css/js directly for mockups is that the designer
      would have to have this skill set, but this is the 21st century, get with the
      times man!</p>

        <h3>No More Mac Pros</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Tue Feb 11 20:53:21 2014</date>
      <p>the mac pro is the desktop/workstation class offering from apple which actually featured
      the very first intel processor ever for apple, all prior workstations (and laptops)
      featured the powerpc chip from motorola, this was a huge announcement and shift
      in apple&#39;s history.  i&#39;ve owned macs since the very first powermac g4 (powerpc
      processor) which was quite a good machine, however, it was running mac os 9.
      mac os x (10.0) was first released running on the quicksilver powermac g4
      which was a completely unusable operating system that had little to no
      native software built for it, you could basically run os 9 in emulation mode and there
      was plenty of software for that, but everything else was purely experimental.  later on,
      10.1 came out that made things better, more native software and developers had jumped
      onto the apple bandwagon semi-full force.  a few years later, i sold my quicksilver
      and purchased a mirrored door powermac g4, this machine was pretty cool, a dual
      processor workstation where at the time very few were to be had.  i had a diy server
      that i pieced together based on a tyan motherboard with 2 sockets for dual pentium 3
      cpu&#39;s, but anything else from a hardware manufacturer was completely out of my price
      range.  in the end, i ran the mirrored door to the ground (power supply failed) and
      due to the design of the case, the power supply wasn&#39;t something that you could replace
      with something from newegg.  there were other issues with the powermac being very picky
      about the memory type (usually ended in kernel panics if you bought the wrong type)
      and the fact that you couldn&#39;t replace graphics cards with off the shelf parts made
      the machine less impressive.  the final push over the edge was the fact that the
      file system was incompatible (hfs) and i couldn&#39;t get my files off the system
      without fixing the machine so i decided to move away from mac, this was the time
      when linux was making a big splash so i decided to go with another home made monster.</p>
      
      <p>it wasn&#39;t until the mac pro came out that i decided to switch back, here i was
      hoping that the system would use off the shelf parts and get rid of some of the
      nuttiness from the previous generations.  boy was i wrong, the same old nuttiness,
      memory timing issues with non-mac memory, incompatibility with off the shelf pci-x
      graphics cards, and even worse, this machine was purchased in 2006, and i found
      out that the operating system can&#39;t be upgraded to the latest mac os x mavericks.  the
      reason is because the mac pro 1 1 runs EFI32 bit firmware which can only boot
      32 bit operating systems.  mac os x made the switch over in 10.8 to full 64 bit
      support which made the mac pro 1 1 incompatible.  the machine is fully capable,
      11 GB of ram (16 GB total), dual quad-core processors (64 bit enabled), and still boasts
      excellent performance, but because of this silly firmware issue, is really a
      piece of garbage.  i have no upgrade path to the latest os x version and i can&#39;t
      even install 64 bit windows or linux operating systems.</p>
      
      <p>at this point, i&#39;m fed up with macs, at least workstations, the whole concept
      of the workstation is to be able to upgrade the machines.  the new mac pro
      sports an interesting cylindrical shape which looks nice, but i question how
      upgradeable this machine will be.  using apple hardware for laptops is alright
      since the upgrades are really incremental and not complete replacements, but
      i&#39;m giving up on mac workstations.  not only is the cost really ridiculous, i
      could probably get the same power in a setup that costs a third less.</p>

        <h3>Playstation 4 and the New Gaming Industry</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Thu Feb  6 10:37:43 2014</date>
      <p><img src="http://cdn.us.playstation.com/pscomauth/groups/public/documents/webasset/ps4-hrdware-large1.jpg" alt="Playstation 4"></p>
      
      <p>playstation 4 launched in mid-november of last year (2013), this is almost 20 years
      after the initial launch of the product and 8 years after the launch of its
      predecessor, the playstation 3, and 14 years after the venerable playstation 2.
      supplies are limited across the world, however, the us version is starting to
      become more widely available, but in essence, there&#39;s no greater time like now
      for sony to pick up the pace in an all new gaming world.</p>
      
      <p>i can&#39;t be 100% certain, but if i recall correctly, sony invented the marketing
      tactic to increase pent up demand by releasing limited quantities of product.
      this seems to be employed by apple and other companies these days, granted there&#39;s
      a real lag in being able to mass produce sophisticated products such as electronics,
      but i would imagine most companies of the time would wait until the manafacturing
      caught up before starting the marketing campaign.  playstation 2 came out in
      mid-november of 2000 and this was the first gaming console with dvd support
      which would boost the storage capacity for games meaning better graphics.  people
      would line up overnight just to be on the waiting list to purchase a console,
      this was also during the beginning of winter which meant frigid temperatures,
      there were even a few instances of fights breaking out to get one of these
      consoles, i believe.  overall this tactic is great for gaming companies because
      this allows the software companies to invest the time in creating better games,
      the ps4 doesn&#39;t have any spectacular games at the moment, all the great ones
      will be coming a few months later.  this is similar to the playstation 2 launch
      except that the playstation 2 is backwards compatible with playstation games,
      and playstation 3 is compatible with all previous generation console games, the
      playstation 4 is not compatible with any previous console games.  this is a bit
      of a strange decision by sony to break all compatibility, but part of this was
      because of the strange decision to use the cell processor in the playstation 3
      which is a completely different computer architecture from the x86-64 instruction
      set in the playstation 4, the only way to create backwards compatibility is to
      use an emulator which would make performance a real issue.  anyway, without
      any killer games, there&#39;s really no rush at the moment to purchase a playstation
      4, all current games can be purchased for playstation 3 as well (at a lower
      price).</p>
      
      <p>in terms of compatibility the recently released microsoft console, xbox one,
      also doesn&#39;t support games from the previous console, xbox 360, which is again,
      a very odd decision.  unlike the playstation 3, the xbox 360 is also leveraging
      the x86 instruction set architecture, so perhaps this is more of a marketing
      decision to push game makers to make games on the latest console.  the hardware
      specifications for the xbox one and playstation 4 are similar, both sport x86-64
      processors from amd and radeon graphics processors.  what really will set the two
      consoles apart will be the games.  however, i contend that the real challenge
      will be from the mass entry of games from tablets and mobile phones which offers
      a bit of a different gaming experience at a fraction of the cost.  some of the
      games on iphone, for example, can compete in terms of graphics capabilities
      and gameplay with those on a  console, however, the experience of having at
      your fingertips, the ability to game anywhere almost anytime while being
      connected will really challenge the legacies of playstation and xbox.  i also
      see the company valve, the maker of the steam which can be installed on diy
      commodity x86 hardware as a real game changer.  the diy community is very adept
      at upgrading hardware to get more gaming power while the console makers are
      pretty much stuck with current generation hardware.  valve doesn&#39;t have a very
      good mobile story at the moment though which puts them at a major disadvantage.</p>
      
      <p>apple and google&#39;s model really change the dynamics of the gaming industry,
      the lower cost of games, often times free compared to 59.99 usd for console
      games, and access from anywhere is really disrupting.  microsoft and sony still
      believe there&#39;s a vibrant community of people that prefer the hardcore
      experience of sitting in a living room, but is this market enough or just a
      niche that will eventually bring the console makers to become obsolete?</p>

        <h3>Experiences with Airbnb</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Tue Feb  4 13:08:25 2014</date>
      <p><img src="https://a0.muscache.com/airbnb/static/about/resources/airbnb-logo-293-1d7ea0761fc6bc1efde1d6e706479392.png" alt="Airbnb"></p>
      
      <p>i first found airbnb on hacker news, the idea didn&#39;t seem that novel, i.e. i
      wasn&#39;t blown away by the technology or business model, more so that i needed
      a nice place to stay and the traditional hotel booking sites never made me feel
      like i was getting the best deal, having a middle man only adds cost.  for those
      not familiar with airbnb, they&#39;re a startup company in the bay area that
      essentially allows you to rent out your room, apartment, or house by the day
      (or month), just like a hotel.  airbnb provides professional photographers
      to help create the best looking images for free.  in return,
      airbnb takes a cut of the rental price and plays as a trusted escrow service.
      like i said, the idea&#39;s not particularly profound despite what the venture
      capitalists are raving about.  anyway, my point&#39;s not really about the startup,
      but more about the service.  my use case is extremely simple, i&#39;m looking for
      highly affordable places to stay via a web app that&#39;s easy to use so that i can
      avoid having to use abominable sites such as orbitz, expedia, ctrip, etc.  these
      trips are typically personal trips so i&#39;m extremely budget conscious, yet
      obviously looking for high value.  i would like to mention that hipmunk is
      an aggregator service, similar to orbitz, expedia, etc, but it does sport
      a much nicer lightweight web app experience in general, however, it&#39;s still
      nothing more than an aggregator and the deals aren&#39;t that great, i.e. how
      much of a discount am i really getting when compared to going directly to
      the provider by using hipmunk.</p>
      
      <p>my first experience with airbnb was quite positive, i was setting up yet
      another shopping excursion to hong kong so location was pretty much everything,
      no point in lugging lots of shopping bags around town all day, something near
      all the good shopping places, clean, and affordable (no point in spending
      several hundreds on a place if all you&#39;re going to do is sleep and shower).  the
      user interface for airbnb is quite simplified, search based on location and
      filters, and the images of the apartments were quite detailed to the point where
      i felt i had a pretty good idea of what i was getting into for each rental.
      in hong kong, there are few houses, mostly apartments and studios.  a lot of
      hosts seemed to be either renting their own place out or some serious landlords
      trying to run a business.  the girl i rented from was a local resident of hong
      kong, educated in america (yale), probably either on business travel or
      vacation, so when we arrived, we basically crashed at her place while she was
      out, all her personal belongings were there, it felt kind of strange seeing
      her travel wish list on the refrigerator door, personal photos, her closet
      full of luxury bags and clothes, or even the dirty laundry (yes, including
      underwear).  i couldn&#39;t tell if the sheets were clean, but the bed was made
      and everything seemed in order.  most hosts have cleaning service before you
      arrive, but i imagine the management of these services is pretty loosely
      defined.  i take it that sheraton cleans all of their sheets, but airbnb
      cleaning lady, probably not.  i&#39;m highly allergic to pet dander so i was
      really afraid of there being past tenants with dogs or cats especially since
      a lot of users of airbnb seem to be hipsters.  and i was constantly thinking
      how dirty the sheets were, you can basically see all the past tenants that left
      reviews for the place in the web app, pictures and profiles.  all in all
      though, the place was convenient, well priced, and clean enough.  i will have
      to say that my second experience was god awful, don&#39;t expect airbnb hosts to be
      as responsive as hotel clerks, sometimes the landlord doesn&#39;t even
      respond to your inquiry, but you have to wait a full 24 hours before figuring
      out that you&#39;re not able to book a place (cancellation of a request doesn&#39;t
      incur penalty).  these are not professional landlords, i assume these people
      have day jobs and also go on vacation sometimes to places where there&#39;s no
      internet access, so there&#39;s no telling if they&#39;ll even get to your request
      in time.  also, i would rate cleanliness of airbnb properties as pretty poor,
      probably case by case, but in general, not up to 3 star hotel standards.  the
      price difference was quite astounding though, we stayed for about 700 hkd/night,
      this was during china&#39;s national holiday in october which is high tide and
      hotels were easily going for 1400 hkd/night in the same area.  and the
      amenities can be greater than a hotel, for example, this studio had a nintendo
      wii, dvd player, ipad, a full library of dvds, and full kitchen including
      utensils.</p>
      
      <p>i think for my use case, airbnb&#39;s not the greatest fit, to find affordable
      housing on short notice and fast response time; however, there are possibilities
      to live in pretty nice places that you&#39;d normally not be able to live by way
      of hotel, take for example a house on the beach with full amenities like outdoor
      grill.  airbnb really goes off the beaten path and does open up opportunities for
      some nice adventures, but the consistency and service level is really not up
      to my standards.  again, all of my experiences are from a traveller&#39;s perspective
      looking for an entire house/studio/apartment to rent and i have not used
      airbnb to host travellers, not sure if i like people going through my personal
      things.</p>

        <h3>China 4G</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Sat Feb  1 09:28:21 2014</date>
      <p><img src="http://www.hk.chinamobile.com/export/system/modules/com.cmhk.page.template.common/resources/en/images/logo.png" alt="China Mobile"></p>
      
      <p>china mobile is the world&#39;s largest mobile carrier with over 700m users.  when
      i moved to china in 2007, there were two other carriers, China Unicom and China
      Telecom, service was limited to 2g (GSM/CDMA/EDGE), but neither was even worthy
      of consideration, both carriers&#39; service and phone selection were really
      sub-standard at the time so pretty much everyone used china mobile.  then came
      3g service, china unicom was first to market in china and they leveraged the
      3g standard that was most prevalent in europe, wcdma.  china telecom went with
      cdma2000 (us standard) and china mobile was forced by the government to
      develop and research the homegrown td-cdma standard.  the chinese telecom
      industry is riddled with a lot of history, but the short summary is that the
      telecom industry used to be fully owned by the government and known as china
      telecom, sometime later china mobile and china unicom were spun off and all
      three companies were privatized.  large portions of all three companies are
      still owned and regulated by the government, but they act as separate
      companies for the most part.</p>
      
      <p>china unicom took early adopters advantage by pushing out their 3g service
      coupled with a great partnership with apple, iphones were subsidized heavily
      (often times free with a long term contract), and china unicom was the only
      player in town that had 3g service for the iphone in the beginning.  later
      on china telecom and china mobile came out with iphone support, but china
      mobile leveraged the super slow and problematic td-cdma technology.</p>
      
      <p>today, a majority of chinese users still leverage 2g services for simple
      phone and text messaging, yet there&#39;s a growing consumer base that requires
      higher bandwidth for all the new mobile apps.</p>
      
      <p>some say that china mobile&#39;s market share was hit hard by the advent of china
      unicom&#39;s iphone and 3g combination, however, i think china unicom and telecom
      spent significant amounts of money for 3g infrastructure, which at the time
      (2012) was already starting to phase out.  in my opinion, china mobile
      purposely invested big on getting 4g out the door before their competitors,
      and curbed spending on 3g.  and on jan 17, 2014 china mobile launched 4g
      services which beat unicom and telecom by many months.</p>
      
      <p>4g is promising technology, and china mobile&#39;s td-lte offering, again
      homegrown technology, has been touted as quite comparable to foreign offerings.
      i&#39;ve actually been fortunate enough to test this in hangzhou while on a cab,
      basically i can watch movies in high definition without any lag.  i&#39;ve been
      a long time china unicom user (since the iphone 4 came out in 2012), and the
      3g service has been just good enough to run some of my apps, however, watching
      movies has been completely inconceivable.  i also find that china unicom&#39;s
      network coverage is really spotty, often times the signal being really weak
      (0-1 bar even in the most populated big cities like beijing and shanghai).</p>
      
      <p>i plopped down for china mobile&#39;s 4g service just to test the waters since i
      had reasonably good experiences with china mobile&#39;s 2g offering and purchased a mifi
      router.  apple (or china mobile) finally conceded and decided to work together
      to offer the iphone 5s/5c on china mobile&#39;s 4g network, however, currently
      you can only find 16 gb models, my pictures already exceed 16 gb!  so i&#39;m
      going to wait until the 64 gb model comes out and the network coverage
      slowly increases.  to this day, i still think china unicom&#39;s coverage is poor,
      but china mobile should have much more funding to invest in proliferation of
      its physical network.  in consolation, if there&#39;s signal, the speed of 4g
      in china is so far so good, movies don&#39;t lag at all.  i&#39;ve also heard that
      china unicom and telecom will lease some of the 4g network from china mobile
      while trying to get approval to use foreign 4g network technologies.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Laptop</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Fri Jan 24 07:05:40 2014</date>
      <p>i&#39;ve been using macbooks for a very long time, my current one from work is
      a fully spec&#39;d out macbook pro retina, 15&quot; screen, 512 gb ssd, 16 gb ram,
      i7 quad core running at 2.7 ghz, a very well built piece of machinery from
      both inside and out, however, it&#39;s a work machine and there&#39;s incredibly
      crufty software put on the thing.  i also owned the very first intel based macbook, the
      black plastic one, and before that, i had purchased several (used) powerbooks based
      on the powerpc processor.  before the macbook craze, one of my favorite
      laptops was the one i received from my first job at hp, it was an hp business
      laptop (can&#39;t remember the model), i opted for an extra battery instead of
      the cd drive which gave me 2 batteries and, at the time, 3-4 hours of battery life which was
      truly unheard of, this was a time when the pentium m processor
      was king, basically an offshoot of the pentium 3 with more power savings.
      (i digress, but the pentium 4 was a new architecture compared to the pentium
      m, but there were energy efficiency issues with the 4 that made the m look
      really good in comparison.)  in between i&#39;ve owned several thinkpads, a netbook
      or 2 and several tablets.</p>
      
      <p>since my initial use of laptops back in 2000 to now, suffice to say, my
      requirements have changed quite dramatically, and, not to mention, the
      technology&#39;s also gotten much, much better.  from a work perspective, i am
      a managing director, but i still keep very close to software development and
      haven&#39;t stopped coding, ever (during non-work hours of course).  so for work, my primary
      use cases are for things like email, office apps (powerpoint, word, excel), some
      browser apps, virtualization (on a rare occassion to install some software
      for various platforms), and some new-fangled apps like evernote, dropbox,
      webex, skype, etc.  screen real estate comes secondary to mobility and ease
      of carrying around from conference room to conference room.  battery life
      plays a critical role, though i think i can get by on 4-5 hours now which
      most laptops today can handle with ease especially since i&#39;m not really doing
      much with the cpu&#39;s like compiling stuff or rendering video.  back in the olden
      days, i&#39;d probably do everything on my laptop, work, play, etc.  now with things
      like ipads, most of the playing has transitioned over and really the focus can
      be 100% on work.  the only problem is that i live a double life, after work,
      i code a bit.  and because mobile apps have become quite popular, i imagine
      i&#39;ll get to that ios app i&#39;ve always been wanting to make which means that i
      need a mac os x based system.  but the coding that i do these days doesn&#39;t
      require compiling, mostly interpreted languages like ruby and then things
      like html/css/js.  i still like to develop in linux, terminal vi style, but
      i also like having a friendly desktop environment like mac os x or windows
      that just makes things easy.  and most of the development that i do these days
      is for distributed web systems, the ability to deploy multiple linux servers
      is a must, this means that i need a hardcore cpu and lots, and lots of memory.
      video cards are not that critical anymore as i don&#39;t play high resolution
      games, so long as it can dual output in high definition to an external display.</p>
      
      <p>as time passes, i find that i&#39;m more accepting of what i&#39;ll deem polyware,
      multiple pieces of hardware, i used to want 1 machine to rule them all, but i&#39;m finding
      that that&#39;s a bit of a hard reality at the moment.  i like my ipad for watching
      movies, playing games, surfing the web, i like my iphone for phone, email,
      text, and social networking, i like my workstation for doing hardcore development and cramming lots
      of spinning disks, and having laptops for work mobility.  i&#39;ve decided that i need
      separate laptops for work and home, there are lots of tools to help synchronize
      things and it&#39;s analogous to having multiple (paper) notebooks to house different
      notes from different classes.</p>
      
      <p>so my ideal laptop is pretty much the macbook air 11&quot; except that the maximum
      memory configuration is 8 gb, i need at least 16 gb, 32 gb would be nice, but
      i imagine that would impact the power requirements.  it&#39;d be nice if they
      could get rid of the frame around the screen and give retina quality output
      on the local display.  i don&#39;t need touchscreen or any of the nonsensical things
      that microsoft&#39;s putting forth, a card reader slot would be nice, and at least
      2 usb slots would be icing on the cake.  i&#39;ll probably wait an iteration or 2
      of the macbook air, for now i&#39;ll just stick with the oblong retina macbook pro.</p>

        <h3>Welcome</h3>
      </a>
      <date>Fri Jan 24 07:05:35 2014</date>
      <p>welcome, this is my very first blog post here!  i&#39;ve been blogging
      for a fairly long time, my very first blog was written in pure html
      back in my college days (circa &#39;96).  i still remember my first text
      editor, it was this gui called crisp that ran on windows, syntax
      highlighting and all!  later on, after graduating, i dabbled a little
      in php and wrote my own blogging app with mysql backend, this was
      all hosted from godaddy, i would upload new files using ftp to a
      linux server running apache in one of godaddy&#39;s datacenters, this
      server was probably hosting several hundred other sites as well.</p>
      
      <p>i had stopped blogging for some time around 2008 or so, part of the
      reasoning was probably because my domain expired, but also because
      micro-blogging tools like facebook and twitter had pretty much taken
      over as communication tools because they were quick and simple (granted
      these tools were blocked in china which is why i never really used these).
      however, sometimes, writing a lengthy post about some particular topic
      without the constraints or associations that come along with
      micro-blogging tools is actually quite refreshing.  tools like tumblr
      and posterous have made blogging easier, and static site generators
      like jekyll have brought back blogging in a new and interesting way.</p>
      
      <p>anyway, it&#39;s great to be back, and i&#39;m actually quite excited to be
      blogging again, and on top of that, i&#39;ve been working on a tool to
      help aide in the process called <a href="https://github.com/stephenhu/meta">meta</a>.</p>
