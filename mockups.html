      <h3>Code Your Mockups</h3>
      <date>Thu Feb 27 22:17:05 2014</date>
      <p>mockups, typically created by designers, are done using one of these
      tools:  adobe illustrator, balsamiq, gomockingbird, powerpoint, visio, hand
      drawing, etc.  quite honestly, i couldn&#39;t really tell you the difference between
      mockups and wireframes, maybe wireframes are rough approximations with no
      attention to colors, fonts, or any of the final visualization details while
      mockups are close to the real thing.  but all of the above methods
      are a bit too cumbersome to me, what i prefer these days, as designer and full
      stack developer, is to directly write html, css, js, and bootstrap.  links are
      hardcoded, some of the ajax requests and data are mocked so i&#39;m actually interacting
      with pretty much the final product down to the color.  this allows me to iterate
      much more quickly and i&#39;m also writing some of the code that eventually gets
      templatized so i&#39;m saving lots of cycles by not having to spin in yet another
      tool that&#39;s really just a bunch of approximations.  and what better thing to do
      than to use firebug or inspect element than to view a bunch of rulers with
      margin width designations.</p>
      
      <p>granted, this method is not as fast initially as a hand drawing, but it&#39;s a lot more
      accurate.  i think in the grand scheme of things, you&#39;ll end up saving more
      time than hand drawings because with a hand drawn mockup, you&#39;d still have to
      translate the drawings into html code.  i think the only real
      argument about using html/css/js directly for mockups is that the designer
      would have to have this skill set, but this is the 21st century, get with the
      times man!</p>
