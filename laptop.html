<h4>Jan 24, 2014</h4>

<p>i&rsquo;ve been using macbooks for a very long time, my current one from work is
a fully spec&rsquo;d out macbook pro retina, 15&rdquo; screen, 512 gb ssd, 16 gb ram,
i7 quad core running at 2.7 ghz, a very well built piece of machinery from
both inside and out, however, it&rsquo;s a work machine and there&rsquo;s incredibly
crufty software put on the thing.  i also owned the very first intel based macbook, the
black plastic one, and before that, i had purchased several (used) powerbooks based
on the powerpc processor.  before the macbook craze, one of my favorite
laptops was the one i received from my first job at hp, it was an hp business
laptop (can&rsquo;t remember the model), i opted for an extra battery instead of
the cd drive which gave me 2 batteries and, at the time, 3-4 hours of battery life which was
truly unheard of, this was a time when the pentium m processor
was king, basically an offshoot of the pentium 3 with more power savings.
(i digress, but the pentium 4 was a new architecture compared to the pentium
m, but there were energy efficiency issues with the 4 that made the m look
really good in comparison.)  in between i&rsquo;ve owned several thinkpads, a netbook
or 2 and several tablets.</p>

<p>since my initial use of laptops back in 2000 to now, suffice to say, my
requirements have changed quite dramatically, and, not to mention, the
technology&rsquo;s also gotten much, much better.  from a work perspective, i am
a managing director, but i still keep very close to software development and
haven&rsquo;t stopped coding, ever (during non-work hours of course).  so for work, my primary
use cases are for things like email, office apps (powerpoint, word, excel), some
browser apps, virtualization (on a rare occassion to install some software
for various platforms), and some new-fangled apps like evernote, dropbox,
webex, skype, etc.  screen real estate comes secondary to mobility and ease
of carrying around from conference room to conference room.  battery life
plays a critical role, though i think i can get by on 4-5 hours now which
most laptops today can handle with ease especially since i&rsquo;m not really doing
much with the cpu&rsquo;s like compiling stuff or rendering video.  back in the olden
days, i&rsquo;d probably do everything on my laptop, work, play, etc.  now with things
like ipads, most of the playing has transitioned over and really the focus can
be 100% on work.  the only problem is that i live a double life, after work,
i code a bit.  and because mobile apps have become quite popular, i imagine
i&rsquo;ll get to that ios app i&rsquo;ve always been wanting to make which means that i
need a mac os x based system.  but the coding that i do these days doesn&rsquo;t
require compiling, mostly interpreted languages like ruby and then things
like html/css/js.  i still like to develop in linux, terminal vi style, but
i also like having a friendly desktop environment like mac os x or windows
that just makes things easy.  and most of the development that i do these days
is for distributed web systems, the ability to deploy multiple linux servers
is a must, this means that i need a hardcore cpu and lots, and lots of memory.
video cards are not that critical anymore as i don&rsquo;t play high resolution
games, so long as it can dual output in high definition to an external display.</p>

<p>as time passes, i find that i&rsquo;m more accepting of what i&rsquo;ll deem polyware,
multiple pieces of hardware, i used to want 1 machine to rule them all, but i&rsquo;m finding
that that&rsquo;s a bit of a hard reality at the moment.  i like my ipad for watching
movies, playing games, surfing the web, i like my iphone for phone, email,
text, and social networking, i like my workstation for doing hardcore development and cramming lots
of spinning disks, and having laptops for work mobility.  i&rsquo;ve decided that i need
separate laptops for work and home, there are lots of tools to help synchronize
things and it&rsquo;s analogous to having multiple (paper) notebooks to house different
notes from different classes.</p>

<p>so my ideal laptop is pretty much the macbook air 11&rdquo; except that the maximum
memory configuration is 8 gb, i need at least 16 gb, 32 gb would be nice, but
i imagine that would impact the power requirements.  it&rsquo;d be nice if they
could get rid of the frame around the screen and give retina quality output
on the local display.  i don&rsquo;t need touchscreen or any of the nonsensical things
that microsoft&rsquo;s putting forth, a card reader slot would be nice, and at least
2 usb slots would be icing on the cake.  i&rsquo;ll probably wait an iteration or 2
of the macbook air, for now i&rsquo;ll just stick with the oblong retina macbook pro.</p>
