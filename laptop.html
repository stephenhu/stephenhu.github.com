      <h3>Ideal Laptop</h3>
      <date>Fri Jan 24 07:05:40 2014</date>
      <p>i&#39;ve been using macbooks for a very long time, my current one from work is
      a fully spec&#39;d out macbook pro retina, 15&quot; screen, 512 gb ssd, 16 gb ram,
      i7 quad core running at 2.7 ghz, a very well built piece of machinery from
      both inside and out, however, it&#39;s a work machine and there&#39;s incredibly
      crufty software put on the thing.  i also owned the very first intel based macbook, the
      black plastic one, and before that, i had purchased several (used) powerbooks based
      on the powerpc processor.  before the macbook craze, one of my favorite
      laptops was the one i received from my first job at hp, it was an hp business
      laptop (can&#39;t remember the model), i opted for an extra battery instead of
      the cd drive which gave me 2 batteries and, at the time, 3-4 hours of battery life which was
      truly unheard of, this was a time when the pentium m processor
      was king, basically an offshoot of the pentium 3 with more power savings.
      (i digress, but the pentium 4 was a new architecture compared to the pentium
      m, but there were energy efficiency issues with the 4 that made the m look
      really good in comparison.)  in between i&#39;ve owned several thinkpads, a netbook
      or 2 and several tablets.</p>
      
      <p>since my initial use of laptops back in 2000 to now, suffice to say, my
      requirements have changed quite dramatically, and, not to mention, the
      technology&#39;s also gotten much, much better.  from a work perspective, i am
      a managing director, but i still keep very close to software development and
      haven&#39;t stopped coding, ever (during non-work hours of course).  so for work, my primary
      use cases are for things like email, office apps (powerpoint, word, excel), some
      browser apps, virtualization (on a rare occassion to install some software
      for various platforms), and some new-fangled apps like evernote, dropbox,
      webex, skype, etc.  screen real estate comes secondary to mobility and ease
      of carrying around from conference room to conference room.  battery life
      plays a critical role, though i think i can get by on 4-5 hours now which
      most laptops today can handle with ease especially since i&#39;m not really doing
      much with the cpu&#39;s like compiling stuff or rendering video.  back in the olden
      days, i&#39;d probably do everything on my laptop, work, play, etc.  now with things
      like ipads, most of the playing has transitioned over and really the focus can
      be 100% on work.  the only problem is that i live a double life, after work,
      i code a bit.  and because mobile apps have become quite popular, i imagine
      i&#39;ll get to that ios app i&#39;ve always been wanting to make which means that i
      need a mac os x based system.  but the coding that i do these days doesn&#39;t
      require compiling, mostly interpreted languages like ruby and then things
      like html/css/js.  i still like to develop in linux, terminal vi style, but
      i also like having a friendly desktop environment like mac os x or windows
      that just makes things easy.  and most of the development that i do these days
      is for distributed web systems, the ability to deploy multiple linux servers
      is a must, this means that i need a hardcore cpu and lots, and lots of memory.
      video cards are not that critical anymore as i don&#39;t play high resolution
      games, so long as it can dual output in high definition to an external display.</p>
      
      <p>as time passes, i find that i&#39;m more accepting of what i&#39;ll deem polyware,
      multiple pieces of hardware, i used to want 1 machine to rule them all, but i&#39;m finding
      that that&#39;s a bit of a hard reality at the moment.  i like my ipad for watching
      movies, playing games, surfing the web, i like my iphone for phone, email,
      text, and social networking, i like my workstation for doing hardcore development and cramming lots
      of spinning disks, and having laptops for work mobility.  i&#39;ve decided that i need
      separate laptops for work and home, there are lots of tools to help synchronize
      things and it&#39;s analogous to having multiple (paper) notebooks to house different
      notes from different classes.</p>
      
      <p>so my ideal laptop is pretty much the macbook air 11&quot; except that the maximum
      memory configuration is 8 gb, i need at least 16 gb, 32 gb would be nice, but
      i imagine that would impact the power requirements.  it&#39;d be nice if they
      could get rid of the frame around the screen and give retina quality output
      on the local display.  i don&#39;t need touchscreen or any of the nonsensical things
      that microsoft&#39;s putting forth, a card reader slot would be nice, and at least
      2 usb slots would be icing on the cake.  i&#39;ll probably wait an iteration or 2
      of the macbook air, for now i&#39;ll just stick with the oblong retina macbook pro.</p>
