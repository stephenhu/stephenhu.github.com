      <h3>Experiences with Airbnb</h3>
      <date>Tue Feb  4 13:08:25 2014</date>
      <p><img src="https://a0.muscache.com/airbnb/static/about/resources/airbnb-logo-293-1d7ea0761fc6bc1efde1d6e706479392.png" alt="Airbnb"></p>
      
      <p>i first found airbnb on hacker news, the idea didn&#39;t seem that novel, i.e. i
      wasn&#39;t blown away by the technology or business model, more so that i needed
      a nice place to stay and the traditional hotel booking sites never made me feel
      like i was getting the best deal, having a middle man only adds cost.  for those
      not familiar with airbnb, they&#39;re a startup company in the bay area that
      essentially allows you to rent out your room, apartment, or house by the day
      (or month), just like a hotel.  airbnb provides professional photographers
      to help create the best looking images for free.  in return,
      airbnb takes a cut of the rental price and plays as a trusted escrow service.
      like i said, the idea&#39;s not particularly profound despite what the venture
      capitalists are raving about.  anyway, my point&#39;s not really about the startup,
      but more about the service.  my use case is extremely simple, i&#39;m looking for
      highly affordable places to stay via a web app that&#39;s easy to use so that i can
      avoid having to use abominable sites such as orbitz, expedia, ctrip, etc.  these
      trips are typically personal trips so i&#39;m extremely budget conscious, yet
      obviously looking for high value.  i would like to mention that hipmunk is
      an aggregator service, similar to orbitz, expedia, etc, but it does sport
      a much nicer lightweight web app experience in general, however, it&#39;s still
      nothing more than an aggregator and the deals aren&#39;t that great, i.e. how
      much of a discount am i really getting when compared to going directly to
      the provider by using hipmunk.</p>
      
      <p>my first experience with airbnb was quite positive, i was setting up yet
      another shopping excursion to hong kong so location was pretty much everything,
      no point in lugging lots of shopping bags around town all day, something near
      all the good shopping places, clean, and affordable (no point in spending
      several hundreds on a place if all you&#39;re going to do is sleep and shower).  the
      user interface for airbnb is quite simplified, search based on location and
      filters, and the images of the apartments were quite detailed to the point where
      i felt i had a pretty good idea of what i was getting into for each rental.
      in hong kong, there are few houses, mostly apartments and studios.  a lot of
      hosts seemed to be either renting their own place out or some serious landlords
      trying to run a business.  the girl i rented from was a local resident of hong
      kong, educated in america (yale), probably either on business travel or
      vacation, so when we arrived, we basically crashed at her place while she was
      out, all her personal belongings were there, it felt kind of strange seeing
      her travel wish list on the refrigerator door, personal photos, her closet
      full of luxury bags and clothes, or even the dirty laundry (yes, including
      underwear).  i couldn&#39;t tell if the sheets were clean, but the bed was made
      and everything seemed in order.  most hosts have cleaning service before you
      arrive, but i imagine the management of these services is pretty loosely
      defined.  i take it that sheraton cleans all of their sheets, but airbnb
      cleaning lady, probably not.  i&#39;m highly allergic to pet dander so i was
      really afraid of there being past tenants with dogs or cats especially since
      a lot of users of airbnb seem to be hipsters.  and i was constantly thinking
      how dirty the sheets were, you can basically see all the past tenants that left
      reviews for the place in the web app, pictures and profiles.  all in all
      though, the place was convenient, well priced, and clean enough.  i will have
      to say that my second experience was god awful, don&#39;t expect airbnb hosts to be
      as responsive as hotel clerks, sometimes the landlord doesn&#39;t even
      respond to your inquiry, but you have to wait a full 24 hours before figuring
      out that you&#39;re not able to book a place (cancellation of a request doesn&#39;t
      incur penalty).  these are not professional landlords, i assume these people
      have day jobs and also go on vacation sometimes to places where there&#39;s no
      internet access, so there&#39;s no telling if they&#39;ll even get to your request
      in time.  also, i would rate cleanliness of airbnb properties as pretty poor,
      probably case by case, but in general, not up to 3 star hotel standards.  the
      price difference was quite astounding though, we stayed for about 700 hkd/night,
      this was during china&#39;s national holiday in october which is high tide and
      hotels were easily going for 1400 hkd/night in the same area.  and the
      amenities can be greater than a hotel, for example, this studio had a nintendo
      wii, dvd player, ipad, a full library of dvds, and full kitchen including
      utensils.</p>
      
      <p>i think for my use case, airbnb&#39;s not the greatest fit, to find affordable
      housing on short notice and fast response time; however, there are possibilities
      to live in pretty nice places that you&#39;d normally not be able to live by way
      of hotel, take for example a house on the beach with full amenities like outdoor
      grill.  airbnb really goes off the beaten path and does open up opportunities for
      some nice adventures, but the consistency and service level is really not up
      to my standards.  again, all of my experiences are from a traveller&#39;s perspective
      looking for an entire house/studio/apartment to rent and i have not used
      airbnb to host travellers, not sure if i like people going through my personal
      things.</p>
