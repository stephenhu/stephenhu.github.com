<h4>Feb 4, 2014</h4>

<p>i first found airbnb on hacker news, the idea didn&rsquo;t seem that novel, i.e. i
wasn&rsquo;t blown away by the technology or business model, more so that i needed
a nice place to stay and the traditional hotel booking sites never made me feel
like i was getting the best deal, having a middle man only adds cost.  for those
not familiar with airbnb, they&rsquo;re a startup company in the bay area that
essentially allows you to rent out your room, apartment, or house by the day
(or month), just like a hotel.  airbnb provides professional photographers
to help create the best looking images for free.  in return,
airbnb takes a cut of the rental price and plays as a trusted escrow service.
like i said, the idea&rsquo;s not particularly profound despite what the venture
capitalists are raving about.  anyway, my point&rsquo;s not really about the startup,
but more about the service.  my use case is extremely simple, i&rsquo;m looking for
highly affordable places to stay via a web app that&rsquo;s easy to use so that i can
avoid having to use abominable sites such as orbitz, expedia, ctrip, etc.  these
trips are typically personal trips so i&rsquo;m extremely budget conscious, yet
obviously looking for high value.  i would like to mention that hipmunk is
an aggregator service, similar to orbitz, expedia, etc, but it does sport
a much nicer lightweight web app experience in general, however, it&rsquo;s still
nothing more than an aggregator and the deals aren&rsquo;t that great, i.e. how
much of a discount am i really getting when compared to going directly to
the provider by using hipmunk.</p>

<p>my first experience with airbnb was quite positive, i was setting up yet
another shopping excursion to hong kong so location was pretty much everything,
no point in lugging lots of shopping bags around town all day, something near
all the good shopping places, clean, and affordable (no point in spending
several hundreds on a place if all you&rsquo;re going to do is sleep and shower).  the
user interface for airbnb is quite simplified, search based on location and
filters, and the images of the apartments were quite detailed to the point where
i felt i had a pretty good idea of what i was getting into for each rental.
in hong kong, there are few houses, mostly apartments and studios.  a lot of
hosts seemed to be either renting their own place out or some serious landlords
trying to run a business.  the girl i rented from was a local resident of hong
kong, educated in america (yale), probably either on business travel or
vacation, so when we arrived, we basically crashed at her place while she was
out, all her personal belongings were there, it felt kind of strange seeing
her travel wish list on the refrigerator door, personal photos, her closet
full of luxury bags and clothes, or even the dirty laundry (yes, including
underwear).  i couldn&rsquo;t tell if the sheets were clean, but the bed was made
and everything seemed in order.  most hosts have cleaning service before you
arrive, but i imagine the management of these services is pretty loosely
defined.  i take it that sheraton cleans all of their sheets, but airbnb
cleaning lady, probably not.  i&rsquo;m highly allergic to pet dander so i was
really afraid of there being past tenants with dogs or cats especially since
a lot of users of airbnb seem to be hipsters.  and i was constantly thinking
how dirty the sheets were, you can basically see all the past tenants that left
reviews for the place in the web app, pictures and profiles.  all in all
though, the place was convenient, well priced, and clean enough.  i will have
to say that my second experience was god awful, don&rsquo;t expect airbnb hosts to be
as responsive as hotel clerks, sometimes the landlord doesn&rsquo;t even
respond to your inquiry, but you have to wait a full 24 hours before figuring
out that you&rsquo;re not able to book a place (cancellation of a request doesn&rsquo;t
incur penalty).  these are not professional landlords, i assume these people
have day jobs and also go on vacation sometimes to places where there&rsquo;s no
internet access, so there&rsquo;s no telling if they&rsquo;ll even get to your request
in time.  also, i would rate cleanliness of airbnb properties as pretty poor,
probably case by case, but in general, not up to 3 star hotel standards.  the
price difference was quite astounding though, we stayed for about 700 hkd/night,
this was during china&rsquo;s national holiday in october which is high tide and
hotels were easily going for 1400 hkd/night in the same area.  and the
amenities can be greater than a hotel, for example, this studio had a nintendo
wii, dvd player, ipad, a full library of dvds, and full kitchen including
utensils.</p>

<p>i think for my use case, airbnb&rsquo;s not the greatest fit, to find affordable
housing on short notice and fast response time; however, there are possibilities
to live in pretty nice places that you&rsquo;d normally not be able to live by way
of hotel, take for example a house on the beach with full amenities like outdoor
grill.  airbnb really goes off the beaten path and does open up opportunities for
some nice adventures, but the consistency and service level is really not up
to my standards.  again, all of my experiences are from a traveller&rsquo;s perspective
looking for an entire house/studio/apartment to rent and i have not used
airbnb to host travellers, not sure if i like people going through my personal
things.</p>
