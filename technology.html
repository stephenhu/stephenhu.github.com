      <h3>Technology and China</h3>
      <date>Wed May 28 09:19:58 2014</date>
      <p>you&#39;ve all probably played or seen the game civilization, the game where you start as a primitive
      culture and then through major technological and philosophical advancements, start to overtake your neighbors
      as you steam roll in tanks and democracy against their archers and feudalism.  and history itself has shown
      that you can&#39;t win a battle of guns versus swords.  over time, technology takes its toll on humanity and forces changes
      whether society is ready for it or not.  and even though china is now the world&#39;s second largest economy
      by gdp and spending power, and soon ready to overtake the states, much of the 1.3 billion population is
      still rather third-world country like, lowly educated with menial spending power and earnings potential.
      but what&#39;s happening here is really quite interesting, more so than a first world country like in the states
      where technological advancements have been happening over the past few decades at an exponential rate.</p>
      
      <p>in china, take a taxi driver, for example, in beijing or shanghai where there&#39;s upwards of 25 million
      population in the urban areas, you can find taxi&#39;s at all sorts of times in the day or night.  the average
      take home pay for a taxi driver was about 3000-5000 rmb per month, based on a 6 rmb to 1 usd ratio, we&#39;re
      talking about 500-950 usd per month.  just to give you some perspective, 500-950 usd a month in
      shanghai or beijing probably means you don&#39;t eat out that often, once or twice a month at most, you
      have a pretty small apartment in an old neighborhood, probably single bedroom in a sketchy part of town,
      40-60 square meters (~400-600 square feet), you don&#39;t save that much per month since food prices and prices
      of goods are on the rise, and most importantly, quality of life is relatively low since you&#39;re working 18-20 hour
      shifts every other day (15 days a month).  however, then comes a set of uber clones, uber&#39;s the taxi
      mobile app in america, in china there have been an explosion of these apps, most notably kuai di da che,
      di di da che, and huang feng, i think there&#39;s already been consolidation of these apps so that there are
      2 major ones, but i digress, my point is not that there are a lot of these types of cloned apps, but the causal
      effects that are happening at an alarming rate to society as this technology is starting to take shape.
      after introduction of these apps, taxi drivers in shanghai and beijing were quoted to be making about
      5000-7000 rmb per month over the last few months which is a 66% increase in pay!  the reason partially
      being that as a marketing ploy, the app makers were giving 5-10 rmb (~1-1.5 usd) per taxi ride to
      drivers, but also now taxi drivers could more intelligently route their days, i.e. instead of taking
      a random person to a random place, they could essentially pick and choose the best opportunity for profit,
      assuming they could win the bid.  but there&#39;s also another effect on society in china, there&#39;s a whole
      business centered around call centers, you could call 24/7 a hotline and get a taxi, basically there&#39;s
      some dispatcher that sends a broadcast to drivers and tries to manually triangulate the closest and
      most willing driver, this person then has to send an sms to the caller with license plate number,
      driver phone number, and estimated time of arrival.  these call centers are now being replaced by
      these apps, almost overnight.  i can&#39;t estimate how many people work at these call centers, but i
      imagine there&#39;s quite a few people that have relied on this as a job for many years.</p>
      
      <p>technology slowly starts to make changes to society, and the less educated will slowly start to
      see major changes to their lifestyles, china for the most part is still a human labor intensive
      economy, it thrives on lower cost, mass amounts of physical labor (lowly educated) which will
      become a large problem long term as other countries become cheaper.  i think the only thing going
      for china&#39;s labor market is not really cost because vietnam, bangladesh, indonesia, india, have much
      lower labor costs and currency valuations, but the sheer size of its population, even if vietnam
      is let&#39;s say 3x cheaper, the fact that you can probably get millions versus thousands of skilled
      laborers makes a huge difference.</p>
      
      <p>the evolution is only starting, there will be more innovations that will start to dramatically change
      society in china and other third world like countries, kind of an interesting place to be.  and i&#39;m
      certain as these changes take effect, the political system will have to evolve as well.</p>
