<h4>Feb 11, 2014</h4>

<p>the mac pro is the desktop/workstation class offering from apple which actually featured
the very first intel processor ever for apple, all prior workstations (and laptops)
featured the powerpc chip from motorola, this was a huge announcement and shift
in apple&rsquo;s history.  i&rsquo;ve owned macs since the very first powermac g4 (powerpc
processor) which was quite a good machine, however, it was running mac os 9.
mac os x (10.0) was first released running on the quicksilver powermac g4
which was a completely unusable operating system that had little to no
native software built for it, you could basically run os 9 in emulation mode and there
was plenty of software for that, but everything else was purely experimental.  later on,
10.1 came out that made things better, more native software and developers had jumped
onto the apple bandwagon semi-full force.  a few years later, i sold my quicksilver
and purchased a mirrored door powermac g4, this machine was pretty cool, a dual
processor workstation where at the time very few were to be had.  i had a diy server
that i pieced together based on a tyan motherboard with 2 sockets for dual pentium 3
cpu&rsquo;s, but anything else from a hardware manufacturer was completely out of my price
range.  in the end, i ran the mirrored door to the ground (power supply failed) and
due to the design of the case, the power supply wasn&rsquo;t something that you could replace
with something from newegg.  there were other issues with the powermac being very picky
about the memory type (usually ended in kernel panics if you bought the wrong type)
and the fact that you couldn&rsquo;t replace graphics cards with off the shelf parts made
the machine less impressive.  the final push over the edge was the fact that the
file system was incompatible (hfs) and i couldn&rsquo;t get my files off the system
without fixing the machine so i decided to move away from mac, this was the time
when linux was making a big splash so i decided to go with another home made monster.</p>

<p>it wasn&rsquo;t until the mac pro came out that i decided to switch back, here i was
hoping that the system would use off the shelf parts and get rid of some of the
nuttiness from the previous generations.  boy was i wrong, the same old nuttiness,
memory timing issues with non-mac memory, incompatibility with off the shelf pci-x
graphics cards, and even worse, this machine was purchased in 2006, and i found
out that the operating system can&rsquo;t be upgraded to the latest mac os x mavericks.  the
reason is because the mac pro 1 1 runs EFI32 bit firmware which can only boot
32 bit operating systems.  mac os x made the switch over in 10.8 to full 64 bit
support which made the mac pro 1 1 incompatible.  the machine is fully capable,
11 GB of ram (16 GB total), dual quad-core processors (64 bit enabled), and still boasts
excellent performance, but because of this silly firmware issue, is really a
piece of garbage.  i have no upgrade path to the latest os x version and i can&rsquo;t
even install 64 bit windows or linux operating systems.</p>

<p>at this point, i&rsquo;m fed up with macs, at least workstations, the whole concept
of the workstation is to be able to upgrade the machines.  the new mac pro
sports an interesting cylindrical shape which looks nice, but i question how
upgradeable this machine will be.  using apple hardware for laptops is alright
since the upgrades are really incremental and not complete replacements, but
i&rsquo;m giving up on mac workstations.  not only is the cost really ridiculous, i
could probably get the same power in a setup that costs a third less.</p>
